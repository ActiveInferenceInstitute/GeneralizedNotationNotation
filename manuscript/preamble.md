# LaTeX Preamble

This file contains project-local LaTeX additions consumed by the template renderer.
Keep it minimal until the manuscript needs additional math, table, or figure support.

Every package below ships with a base TeX Live installation. Anything outside that
set must be loaded through the `\IfFileExists` guard the template itself uses for
`seqsplit` (see `output/pdf/_combined_manuscript.tex`), so a missing package
degrades instead of failing the build:

```
\IfFileExists{pkg.sty}{\usepackage{pkg}}{<fallback definition>}
```

`cleveref` was loaded here unguarded until 2026-09-05. It resolved only from a
hand-installed personal `texmf` tree (`kpsewhich cleveref.sty` →
`~/Library/texmf/...`, an eight-year-old copy that triggered LaTeX's "First Aid"
patch), it is absent from the `texlive-basic` scheme, and the document contains
zero `\cref`/`\Cref` calls — every cross-reference goes through pandoc-crossref,
which emits plain `\ref`. Reinstating it means guarding it AND converting the
`\ref` calls.

% Contents listing: article.cls prefixes every \l@section entry with
% \addvspace{1.0em}, which across ten sections costs about ten lines and pushed
% the ~40-entry listing one line past page 2 — leaving a third sheet carrying a
% single "10 References" line. Tighten that inter-section gap for the duration
% of \tableofcontents only, inside a group, so body spacing is untouched and no
% entry is dropped (reducing \tocdepth would have hidden 29 real subsections).

% Bounded identifier splitting. The template defines
%   \protected\def\breaktt#1{\begingroup\ttfamily\seqsplit{#1}\endgroup}
% and \seqsplit permits a break after EVERY character with no continuation cue.
% In the 2026-09-05 PDF that rendered `model_family_manifest.json` as
% `model_family_manifest.js` + `on` and `src/manuscript_variables.py` as
% `(src/manusc` + `ript_variables.py` — the first is itself a valid filename, so
% a reader cannot tell a line break from a name. Keep seqsplit's guarantee that
% no code token overflows the measure, but forbid breaks inside the last
% \GNNttTail characters (an extension is never orphaned) and inside the first
% \GNNttHead (a one- or two-letter stub is never left behind).
