# GNN File Structure

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the structure and organization of GNN files.

## Overview

A GNN file is structured as a Markdown document with specific sections that describe different aspects of an Active Inference model. The file follows a standardized format that enables both human readability and machine processing.

```

## Required Sections

A complete GNN file includes the following sections in this order:

### 1. GNN Version and Flags

Specifies the version of GNN being used and any optional flags or settings that affect interpretation.

```
## GNN v1
flags=latex_rendering,graphviz_compatible
```

This section indicates compatibility with specific tools or specifications.

### 2. Model Name

Provides a unique identifier for the model, typically as a top-level header.

```
# Dynamic Perception Model v2.1
```

The model name should be concise but descriptive, often including version information.

### 3. Model Annotation

A free-text description of the model, its purpose, context, and key features.

```
## Model annotations
This model implements a dynamic perception process with hidden states 
and observations evolving over time. It demonstrates basic perceptual 
inference without action selection.
```

This section helps users understand the model's purpose and scope.

### 4. State Space Block

Defines all variables in the model, including their dimensions and types.

```
## State space block
s_t[2,1,type=float]  # Hidden state (2-dimensional column vector)
o_t[2,1,type=float]  # Observation (2-dimensional column vector)
A[2,2,type=float]    # Recognition matrix (2x2 matrix)
B[2,2,type=float]    # Transition matrix (2x2 matrix)
D[2,1,type=float]    # Prior (2-dimensional column vector)
t[1,type=int]        # Time index (scalar)
```

This section is crucial for understanding the model's structure and computational requirements.

### 5. Connections

Describes the causal relationships between variables using directed and undirected edges.

```
## Connections
D-s_t    # Prior constrains hidden state
s_t-A    # Hidden state relates to recognition matrix
A-o_t    # Recognition matrix relates to observation
s_t-B    # Hidden state relates to transition matrix
B-s_t+1  # Transition matrix determines next state
```

The connections section defines the graphical structure of the model.

```mermaid
graph LR
    D[Prior D] --- S[State s_t]
    S --- A[Recognition A]
    A --- O[Observation o_t]
    S --- B[Transition B]
    B --- S1[State s_t+1]
    
    classDef state fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    classDef obs fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    classDef matrix fill:#fcf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    
    class S,S1 state;
    class O obs;
    class A,B,D matrix;
```

### 6. Initial Parameterization

Sets the starting values for parameters and variables in the model.

```
## Initial Parameterization
D={0.5,0.5}
A={(.9,.1),(.2,.8)}
B={(.7,.3),(.3,.7)}
```

This section provides the concrete values needed to initialize the model.

### 7. Equations

Contains the mathematical formulas that define the model's dynamics, typically expressed in LaTeX.

```
## Equations
s_{tau=1}=softmax((1/2)(ln(D)+ln(B^dagger_tau*s_{tau+1})+ln(trans(A)o_tau))
s_{tau>1}=softmax((1/2)(ln(D)+ln(B^dagger_tau*s_{tau+1})+ln(trans(A)o_tau))
```

The equations specify how variables evolve and interact over time.

### 8. Time

Describes how the model handles time, including whether it's static or dynamic, discrete or continuous.

```
## Time
Dynamic
DiscreteTime=s_t
ModelTimeHorizon=10
```

This section is crucial for understanding the model's temporal characteristics.

### 9. ActInf Ontology Annotation

Maps variables to standardized terms in the Active Inference Ontology for consistent interpretation.

```
## Active Inference Ontology
A=RecognitionMatrix
B=TransitionMatrix
D=Prior
s_t=HiddenState
o_t=Observation
t=Time
```

This mapping enables interoperability with other Active Inference models and tools.

### 10. Footer

A closing section that marks the end of the model definition, typically repeating the model name.

```
# Dynamic Perception Model v2.1
```

### 11. Signature

Optional cryptographic or authorship information validating the file's provenance.

```
## Signature
Author: Jane Smith
Date: 2023-06-15
Hash: a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0
```

## Example of a Complete GNN File

Below is an example of a complete GNN file for a simple dynamic perception model:

```
## GNN v1

# Simple Dynamic Perception Model

## Model annotations
This model demonstrates perceptual inference with a 
two-dimensional hidden state and observation space.
The model updates beliefs over discrete time steps.

## State space block

o_t[2,1,type=float]  # Observation
A[2,2,type=float]    # Recognition matrix
B[2,2,type=float]    # Transition matrix
D[2,1,type=float]    # Prior
t[1,type=int]        # Time index

## Connections
D-s_t
s_t-A
A-o_t
s_t-B
B-s_t+1

B={(.7,.3),(.3,.7)}

## Equations
s_{tau=1}=softmax((1/2)(ln(D)+ln(B^dagger_tau*s_{tau+1})+ln(trans(A)o_tau))
s_{tau>1}=softmax((1/2)(ln(D)+ln(B^dagger_tau*s_{tau+1})+ln(trans(A)o_tau))

## Time

## File Structure Visualization

The overall structure of a GNN file follows this pattern:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Metadata
    participant V as Variables
    participant D as Dynamics
    participant O as Ontology
    participant F as Footer
    
    Note over M: GNN Version and Flags
    Note over M: Model Name
    Note over M: Model Annotation
    
    Note over V: State Space Block
    Note over V: Connections
    Note over V: Initial Parameterization
    
    Note over D: Equations
    Note over D: Time
    
    Note over O: ActInf Ontology Annotation
    
    Note over F: Footer
    Note over F: Signature
```

## Progressive Model Development

GNN files support incremental model development by allowing sections to be extended or refined:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Simple
        S1[Basic Variables]
        S2[Simple Connections]
        S3[Basic Equations]
    end
    
    subgraph Intermediate
        I1[Extended Variables]
        I2[More Connections]
        I3[Enhanced Equations]
        I4[Time Dynamics]
    end
    
    subgraph Advanced
        A1[Policy Variables]
        A2[Preference Variables]
        A3[Complex Dynamics]
        A4[Free Energy Terms]
    end
    
    Simple --> Intermediate
    Intermediate --> Advanced
```

A model can start as a simple perceptual model and progressively add features:
1. Start with basic perception (states, observations)
2. Add temporal dynamics (transitions over time)
3. Incorporate action selection (policies)
4. Include preferences and expected free energy

## Best Practices for GNN Files

When creating GNN files:

1. **Follow the section order** presented above for consistency
2. **Use clear variable names** that reflect their role in the model
3. **Include detailed annotations** to explain model purpose and components
4. **Be precise with dimensionality** specifications for all variables
5. **Match ontology terms** to standardized Active Inference concepts
6. **Validate equations** for mathematical correctness
7. **Use consistent formatting** throughout the document
8. **Include version information** for both GNN and your model

## Machine-Readable Format

For automated processing, GNN file structures are available in a machine-readable format at `src/gnn/documentation/file_structure.md`, which defines each section and its expected content.
