# Generalized Notation Notation (GNN)

Generalized Notation Notation (GNN) is a text-based language designed to standardize the representation of Active Inference generative models, improving clarity, reproducibility, and interoperability across domains. It defines a concise ASCII syntax for model components, a structured file format, and supports multiple modalities—textual, graphical, and executable—facilitating seamless communication among researchers and tools.

## Motivation and Goals

GNN addresses the lack of a unified representation for Active Inference models, which are often described using disparate mixtures of natural language, pseudocode, mathematical formulas, and diagrams. By providing a formalized syntax and file structure, GNN aims to:

- Streamline collaboration and model sharing across research groups
- Enable automated rendering into mathematical notation, figures, and code
- Bridge gaps between ontologies, morphology, grammar, and pragmatics in Active Inference modeling
- Facilitate interdisciplinary research and application
- Ensure reproducibility of computational cognitive models
- Create a standardized way to document model implementations

## GNN Syntax and Punctuation

GNN leverages standard ASCII symbols to denote variables, operations, and causal relationships in generative models. The complete specification is maintained in machine-readable format at `src/gnn/documentation/punctuation.md`. 

The syntax is designed to be both human-readable and machine-parsable, making it suitable for documentation and automated processing. Key symbols include:

| Symbol | Meaning                             | Example    | Interpretation                           |
|--------|-------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------|
| ,      | List separator                      | X,Y        | Elements X and Y                         |
| _      | Subscript                           | X_2        | Variable X with subscript 2              |
| ^      | Superscript                         | X^Y        | Variable X with superscript Y            |
| =      | Equality or assignment              | X=5        | X is set to 5                            |
| >      | Directed causal edge                | X>Y        | Causal influence from X to Y             |
| -      | Undirected causal edge              | X-Y        | Undirected relation between X and Y      |
| ()     | Grouping                            | (X+Y)      | Parenthesized expression                 |
| {}     | Exact value specification           | X{1}       | X equals 1                               |
| []     | Dimensionality or indexing          | X[2,3]     | X is a 2×3 matrix                        |
| # / ## / ### | Markdown headings and comments | ## Title  | Section header in GNN source file        |
| +      | Addition                            | X+Y        | Sum of X and Y                           |
| *      | Multiplication                      | X*Y        | Product of X and Y                       |

| \|     | Conditional probability             | P(X\|Y)    | Probability of X given Y                 |

### Syntax Guidelines

When writing GNN expressions:

1. **Variables** should be concise, meaningful identifiers
2. **Dimensionality** should be specified using square brackets, e.g., `X[2,3]` for a 2×3 matrix
3. **Causal relationships** should be denoted with directed (>) or undirected (-) edges
4. **Mathematical operations** should use standard operators (+, -, *, /)
5. **Comments** can be added using triple hashtags (###)

## GNN Source File Structure

A GNN source file follows a Markdown-like organization that segments model metadata, variables, connections, and equations. The complete specification is maintained in machine-readable format at `src/gnn/documentation/file_structure.md`. 

Each GNN file is organized into the following sections:

1. **GNN Version and Flags**: Specification of GNN release and optional flags that govern the file's interpretation.

2. **Model Name**: Descriptive identifier for the model, providing a concise label for reference.

3. **Model Annotation**: Free-text caption explaining the model's purpose, context, and key features. This section allows for more detailed description than the name alone.

4. **State Space Block**: Definitions of variables and their dimensions/types. This section specifies all variables used in the model, including their dimensionality (e.g., scalar, vector, matrix) and data types.

5. **Connections**: Directed or undirected edges specifying dependencies between variables. This section defines the graphical structure of the model, showing how variables influence each other.

6. **Initial Parameterization**: Starting values for parameters and variables, which may include constants, distributions, or specific values for model initialization.

7. **Equations**: LaTeX-rendered formulas defining model dynamics and the mathematical relationships between variables. These equations specify how variables change over time or in response to inputs.

8. **Time**: Discrete or continuous time settings and horizons, including whether the model is static or dynamic, how time is represented, and the time horizon for simulation.

9. **ActInf Ontology Annotation**: Mapping of variables to Active Inference Ontology terms, which standardizes the interpretation of variables and facilitates cross-model comparison.

10. **Footer and Signature**: File closure and provenance information, potentially including cryptographic signatures for verification.

### Machine-Readable Format

The GNN file structure is designed to be machine-readable, with each section clearly delineated by Markdown headers. This allows for automated parsing and processing of GNN files, enabling:

- Validation of GNN syntax and structure
- Automatic conversion to computational implementations
- Visualization of model structure
- Cross-model comparison and analysis

## Progressive Model Development with GNN

GNN supports an incremental approach to model development, allowing practitioners to start with simple models and progressively add complexity. Models can be extended by:

1. Adding new variables to the state space
2. Introducing additional connections between variables
3. Refining equations to capture more complex dynamics
4. Incorporating temporal components for dynamic models
5. Adding policy selection mechanisms for active inference

The examples in `src/gnn/gnn_examples/` demonstrate this progression from simple to complex models, following the tutorial by Smith et al. (2022).

## Step-by-Step Example: Static to Dynamic Models

The progression from static to dynamic models in GNN typically follows these steps:

1. **Static Perception Model**: Basic model with hidden states, observations, and recognition matrix.

2. **Dynamic Perception Model**: Adds time dimension and transition matrices to model state changes over time.

3. **Dynamic Perception with Policy Selection**: Incorporates action selection through policy variables and expected free energy.

4. **Dynamic Perception with Flexible Policy Selection**: Adds preference learning and adaptive policy selection mechanisms.

### Example: Simple Perception Model in GNN

```
# Simple Perception Model
## Model Annotation
A basic model of perceptual inference with hidden states and observations.

## State Space Block
s[2]    # Hidden state with 2 possible values
o[2]    # Observation with 2 possible values

## Connections
s>o     # Hidden states cause observations

## Initial Parameterization
A=[[0.7,0.3],[0.3,0.7]]  # State transition matrix
B=[[0.9,0.1],[0.1,0.9]]  # Observation likelihood matrix

## Time
Dynamic
DiscreteTime=t
ModelTimeHorizon=10

## ActInf Ontology Annotation
s=HiddenState
o=Observation
A=StateTransitionMatrix
B=ObservationLikelihoodMatrix
```

## The Triple Play: Modalities of GNN

GNN expressions support three complementary modalities for model representation, which can be used together for comprehensive model documentation:

1. **Text-Based Models**: Plain-text GNN files render directly into formulas, pseudocode, or prose using tools like regex or LLMs. This modality provides a human-readable specification that can be shared in papers, documentation, and educational materials.

2. **Graphical Models**: GNN specifies nodes and edges that can be visualized as factor graphs, clarifying dependencies and causal structure. The graphical representation enhances understanding of model architecture and facilitates communication of complex relationships.

3. **Executable Cognitive Models**: GNN serves as pseudocode to generate simulations in any programming environment, ensuring backwards- and forwards-compatibility across software implementations. This modality enables computational verification of model behavior and supports empirical research.

### Benefits of the Triple Play Approach

- **Completeness**: Different aspects of the model are captured in complementary ways
- **Accessibility**: Various stakeholders can engage with the representation that suits their needs
- **Verification**: Multiple representations allow cross-checking for consistency
- **Interoperability**: Models can be shared and implemented across different platforms

## Implementation Guidelines

### Translating GNN to Code

When implementing a GNN model in code:

1. **Variable Declaration**: Define variables according to their dimensionality in the State Space Block
2. **Initialization**: Use the Initial Parameterization section to set starting values
3. **Function Definition**: Implement equations as functions in your target language
4. **Temporal Logic**: For dynamic models, implement time steps according to the Time section
5. **Connections**: Ensure that variable dependencies follow the structure defined in the Connections section

### Visualization Tools

Visualization of GNN models can be implemented using:

- **Graph libraries**: NetworkX, Graphviz, or D3.js for rendering connection structures
- **LaTeX renderers**: For equation display in documentation
- **Custom renderers**: For specialized visualizations of model components

### Validation Process

To validate a GNN implementation:

1. Check that all variables have the correct dimensions
2. Verify that all connections are properly implemented
3. Compare equation implementations against the LaTeX definitions
4. Test temporal behavior for dynamic models
5. Validate against expected outcomes or benchmark datasets

## Tools and Resources

To work with GNN, several tools and approaches can be used:

- **Parsing**: Standard CSV parsers can process the machine-readable specifications
- **Visualization**: Graph visualization libraries can render GNN connections
- **Simulation**: The model structure can be translated to executable code
- **Verification**: GNN files can be validated against the specification
- **GNN Repository**: Access examples and tools at the [GNN GitHub repository](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/GeneralizedNotationNotation)
