# D2 (Declarative Diagramming): Comprehensive Technical Overview and Setup Guide

D2 is a modern, declarative diagram scripting language developed by Terrastruct that transforms text into professional diagrams through a sophisticated compilation pipeline. As an open-source project written in Go, D2 represents a significant advancement in the text-to-diagram tooling ecosystem, offering capabilities that extend beyond traditional solutions like Mermaid through its rich feature set, multiple layout engines, and programmatic API.[1][2][3]

## Core Architecture and Design Philosophy

D2 operates on a fundamentally different paradigm than imperative diagramming tools by allowing developers and technical professionals to declare relationships and structures rather than specify exact positions and rendering instructions. The language compiles .d2 source files through an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into various output formats including SVG, PNG, PDF, and HTML. This compilation process leverages pluggable layout engines that handle the complex graph layout algorithms, separating concerns between logical structure definition and visual presentation.[4][5][6][7]

The architectural philosophy emphasizes modularity, extensibility, and integration into existing technical workflows. D2 supports completely offline operation through its CLI while simultaneously offering cloud-based playground functionality for rapid prototyping and sharing.[8][4]

## Installation Methods and Platform Support

### Recommended Installation via Install Script

The officially recommended installation method uses an intelligent install script that automatically detects the optimal installation approach for your system. This script checks for available package managers and selects the most appropriate method:[1]

```bash
curl -fsSL https://d2lang.com/install.sh | sh -s --
```

After installation, verify successful setup by running:

```bash
d2 version
```

To uninstall using the same script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://d2lang.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --uninstall
```

### Platform-Specific Installation Methods

**macOS via Homebrew:**
```bash
brew install d2
```

**Windows Installation:**
D2 provides .msi installer packages available through the official releases page, and is also available via Winget package manager.[3][4]

**Linux Systems:**
Multiple distribution-specific package managers support D2, including apt, yum, and others depending on your distribution.[9][1]

**Installation from Source (Go):**
For developers with Go installed, direct installation from source is available:

```bash
go install oss.terrastruct.com/d2@latest
```

This method requires Go to be properly configured on your system with GOPATH and GOBIN environment variables set.[3]

**Docker Installation:**
While available, Docker installation is noted as more complex and generally not recommended unless containerization is specifically required for your workflow.[3]

**Precompiled Binaries:**
Platform-specific precompiled binaries are available from the GitHub releases page at https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/releases.[1]

### Editor Integration

**VSCode:** Official extension provides syntax highlighting, live preview, and integrated compilation.[4]

**Vim:** Official plugin support with syntax highlighting and compilation capabilities.[4]

Additional community extensions exist for other editors through the D2 ecosystem.[4]

## CLI Usage and Commands

### Basic Command Structure

The D2 CLI follows a straightforward syntax pattern:

```bash
d2 [OPTIONS] INPUT_FILE [OUTPUT_FILE]
```

### Essential CLI Operations

**Compile to Static Output:**
```bash
d2 input.d2 output.svg
d2 input.d2 output.png
d2 input.d2 output.pdf
```

**Watch Mode for Development:**
```bash
d2 --watch input.d2
```

Watch mode launches a local web server with live reload functionality, automatically refreshing the rendered diagram whenever the source file changes. This provides an interactive development experience essential for iterative diagram refinement.[1][3]

**Format D2 Source Files:**
D2 includes an autoformatter that handles indentation, spacing, and stylistic conventions:

```bash
d2 fmt input.d2
```

The autoformatter removes unnecessary syntax elements like redundant relative import paths and normalizes code structure.[10][11]

### Advanced CLI Options

**Theme Selection:**
```bash
d2 -t 1 input.d2 output.svg
d2 --theme=200 input.d2 output.png
```

List available themes:
```bash
d2 list-themes
```

D2 offers numerous professionally designed themes including "Mixed Berry Blue," "Vanilla Nitro Cola," "Grape Soda," and specialized themes like "Terminal" that modify default rendering behavior beyond just colors.[12][4]

**Dark Mode Support:**
```bash
d2 --dark-theme=100 input.d2 output.svg
```

Diagrams can adapt to user system preferences, automatically switching between light and dark themes when embedded in web pages.[12][4]

**Layout Engine Selection:**
```bash
d2 --layout=dagre input.d2 output.svg
d2 --layout=elk input.d2 output.svg
d2 --layout=tala input.d2 output.svg
```

Environment variable alternative:
```bash
D2_LAYOUT=elk d2 input.d2 output.svg
```

List available layout engines and their options:
```bash
d2 layout
d2 layout dagre
```

**Sketch Mode:**
```bash
d2 --sketch input.d2 output.svg
d2 -s input.d2 output.png
```

Sketch mode renders diagrams with a hand-drawn aesthetic, useful for wireframes, brainstorming documents, and informal presentations.[13][4]

**Custom Fonts:**
```bash
d2 --font /path/to/font.ttf input.d2 output.svg
```

D2 accepts custom TrueType fonts (.ttf) for complete typographic control.[4]

**Padding Configuration:**
```bash
d2 --pad 20 input.d2 output.svg
d2 -p 50 input.d2 output.png
```

**Animation Support:**
```bash
d2 --animate input.d2 output.svg
```

D2 uniquely supports animated diagrams, generating SVGs with embedded animation sequences.[4]

**Multi-diagram Compilation:**
```bash
d2 --target-id=diagram2 input.d2 output.svg
```

Target specific diagrams within files containing multiple diagram definitions.[6]

**Configuration File:**
```bash
d2 --config config.toml input.d2 output.svg
```

TOML-based configuration files allow project-wide or global defaults.[6]

## Language Syntax and Core Concepts

### Fundamental Constructs

**Nodes (Shapes):**
The simplest D2 construct defines shapes by declaring identifiers:

```d2
users
api
database
```

This creates three rectangular shapes with their identifiers as labels.[5]

**Connections (Edges):**
The arrow operator `->` establishes directed connections:

```d2
users -> api
api -> database
```

Bidirectional connections use `<->`:

```d2
client <-> server
```

**Connection Labels:**
```d2
users -> api: HTTP requests
api -> database: SQL queries
```

Labels provide semantic meaning to relationships.[5]

**Shape Customization:**
```d2
users: Users {
  shape: person
}

api: API Gateway {
  shape: hexagon
}

cache: Redis {
  shape: cylinder
}

cloud: AWS {
  shape: cloud
}

decision: Route Traffic {
  shape: diamond
}
```

### Available Shape Types

D2 supports an extensive shape catalog including rectangle (default), square, page, parallelogram, document, cylinder, queue, package, step, callout, stored_data, person, diamond, oval, circle, hexagon, cloud, and more specialized shapes for specific diagram types.[14][4]

### Containers and Hierarchical Organization

Containers group related shapes, creating visual and logical hierarchy:

```d2
aws: {
  ec2: EC2 Instances {
    shape: rectangle
  }
  rds: Database {
    shape: cylinder
  }
  s3: Object Storage {
    shape: oval
  }
  
  ec2 -> rds
  ec2 -> s3
}
```

Containers support first-class operations including connections to/from containers, nested containers, and styling.[4]

### Styling and Appearance

**Colors:**
```d2
server: {
  style: {
    fill: "#ff6b6b"
    stroke: "#c92a2a"
    font-color: "#ffffff"
  }
}
```

**Border and Stroke Styling:**
```d2
box: {
  style: {
    stroke-width: 4
    stroke-dash: 5
    border-radius: 8
    double-border: true
  }
}
```

**Fill Patterns:**
```d2
container: {
  style: {
    fill-pattern: dots
  }
}
```

Pattern options include dots, lines, and grain.[12]

### Variables and Substitutions

D2 supports variable definition and substitution for maintainable diagram code:

```d2
vars: {
  primary-color: "#4A90E2"
  secondary-color: "#F39C12"
  db-shape: cylinder
}

database: Production DB {
  shape: ${db-shape}
  style.fill: ${primary-color}
}

cache: Cache Layer {
  shape: ${db-shape}
  style.fill: ${secondary-color}
}
```

Variables support nesting, scoping rules similar to programming languages, and spread operators for maps and arrays.[10]

**Configuration Variables:**
Certain configurations can be specified directly in the vars block:

```d2
vars: {
  d2-config: {
    theme-id: 1
    pad: 10
    sketch: true
  }
}
```

These configuration variables can be overridden by command-line flags and environment variables.[10]

### Imports and Modularity

D2 supports modular diagram construction through imports, enabling separation of concerns and reusability:

**Regular Import:**
```d2
# File: main.d2
network: @infrastructure
```

**Spread Import:**
```d2
# File: main.d2
...@common-components
```

**Partial Imports:**
```d2
# Import specific objects from a file
managers: @people.managers
```

**Relative Imports:**
```d2
...@../shared/network
```

**Absolute Imports:**
```d2
...@/Users/project/diagrams/base
```

Imports reference files without the .d2 extension, and the autoformatter normalizes import syntax.[11]

### Advanced Language Features

**Globs for Bulk Operations:**
```d2
*.style.fill: blue
server*.style.stroke: red
```

Wildcard patterns enable efficient batch styling.[4]

**Markdown Support:**
```d2
explanation: |md
  # Architecture Overview
  
  This system uses a **microservices** architecture with:
  
  - Service discovery
  - Load balancing
  - Circuit breakers
|
```

Longform explanations integrate seamlessly with diagram elements.[4]

**Code Snippets with Syntax Highlighting:**
```d2
implementation: |go
  func processRequest(ctx context.Context) error {
      client := getClient()
      return client.Execute(ctx)
  }
|
```

D2 supports syntax highlighting for multiple programming languages.[4]

**LaTeX Mathematical Expressions:**
```d2
formula: |latex
  \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
|
```

LaTeX rendering makes D2 suitable for academic and research documentation.[4]

**Interactive Elements:**
```d2
documentation: Documentation {
  link: https://docs.example.com
  tooltip: Click to view full documentation
}
```

Generated diagrams support clickable links and hover tooltips.[4]

## Layout Engines: Technical Comparison

D2 supports three distinct layout engines, each optimized for different diagram types and constraints.[7][13]

### Dagre (Default)

Dagre implements a fast, directed graph layout algorithm based on Graphviz's DOT approach, producing layered/hierarchical layouts. As the default engine, Dagre provides excellent performance for most use cases and handles general-purpose diagrams effectively. However, it has limitations including inability to render connections from ancestor containers to their descendants.[7]

**Activation:**
```bash
d2 --layout=dagre input.d2 output.svg
```

### ELK (Eclipse Layout Kernel)

ELK represents a more mature directed graph layout engine maintained by a part-time academic research team with active development. ELK offers superior layout quality for complex diagrams and better maintenance compared to Dagre. Notably, ELK is the only non-TALA layout engine supporting width and height constraints on containers.[13][7]

**Activation:**
```bash
d2 --layout=elk input.d2 output.svg
```

ELK generally produces cleaner layouts for complex architectural diagrams compared to Dagre, though with marginally increased processing time.[13]

### TALA (Terrastruct Automatic Layout Algorithm)

TALA is D2's proprietary layout engine designed specifically for software architecture diagrams. As the only layout engine fully controlled by the D2 team, TALA supports advanced features unavailable in other engines:[7]

- Setting `near` to another object for proximity constraints
- Position locking via `top` and `left` attributes
- Per-container direction specification
- Future support for container width/height constraints

TALA requires a paid subscription for production use, though evaluation licenses are available.[13]

**Activation:**
```bash
d2 --layout=tala input.d2 output.svg
```

### Layout-Specific Functionality

The choice of layout engine impacts available features:[7]

- **near object positioning:** TALA only (all engines support near constants)
- **Container width/height:** ELK only (TALA planned)
- **Position locking (top/left):** TALA only
- **Ancestor-descendant connections:** ELK and TALA only

### Direction Control

All layout engines support global direction specification:

```d2
direction: down  # Options: up, down, left, right
```

TALA uniquely supports per-container direction:

```d2
container1: {
  direction: right
}

container2: {
  direction: down
}
```

This enables mixed-direction diagrams within a single canvas.[7]

## Specialized Diagram Types

### Sequence Diagrams

D2 implements sequence diagrams through a special shape type with unique scoping and ordering semantics:[15]

```d2
sequence: {
  shape: sequence_diagram
  
  alice
  bob
  
  alice -> bob: Authentication Request
  bob -> alice: Authentication Response
  
  alice -> bob: Another Request
  bob -> alice: Another Response
}
```

**Key Differences from Standard D2:**

1. **Shared Scoping:** All children share the same scope throughout the diagram, unlike normal containers where nested objects would create separate instances.[15]

2. **Order Significance:** Declaration order determines visual appearance, unlike standard D2 where order is non-deterministic.[15]

**Sequence Diagram Features:**

**Spans (Activation Boxes):**
```d2
sequence: {
  shape: sequence_diagram
  
  client
  server
  
  client -> server.process: Request
  server.process -> server.process: Processing
  server.process -> client: Response
}
```

**Groups (Fragments):**
```d2
sequence: {
  shape: sequence_diagram
  
  alice
  bob
  
  login: {
    alice -> bob: Enter credentials
    bob -> alice: Validate
  }
  
  transaction: {
    alice -> bob: Submit order
    bob -> alice: Confirm
  }
}
```

**Notes:**
```d2
sequence: {
  shape: sequence_diagram
  
  user
  system
  
  user -> system: Action
  
  system.note: This processes
  in the background
}
```

**Self-Messages:**
```d2
sequence: {
  shape: sequence_diagram
  
  processor
  
  processor -> processor: Self-check
}
```

**Customization:**
Sequence diagram elements accept standard D2 styling:

```d2
sequence: {
  shape: sequence_diagram
  
  alice: {
    shape: person
  }
  
  server: {
    shape: rectangle
  }
  
  alice -> server: Request {
    style.stroke-dash: 5
  }
}
```

### UML Class Diagrams

D2 provides complete UML class diagram support with fields, methods, visibility modifiers, and types:[16]

```d2
User: {
  shape: class
  
  # Fields
  -id: int
  -username: string
  -email: string
  +createdAt: DateTime
  
  # Methods
  +getUsername(): string
  +setEmail(email: string): void
  +authenticate(password: string): boolean
  #hashPassword(password: string): string
}

Post: {
  shape: class
  
  -id: int
  -title: string
  -content: text
  -authorId: int
  
  +publish(): void
  +delete(): boolean
}

User -> Post: "1" -> "*"
```

**Visibility Prefixes:**
- No prefix or `+`: public
- `-`: private
- `#`: protected

**Method Syntax:**
Methods are identified by containing `(` in their key. The value represents the return type, with empty values indicating void.[16]

**Complex Types:**
```d2
Repository: {
  shape: class
  
  -connection: DatabaseConnection
  +findById(id: int): Optional<Entity>
  +findAll(): List<Entity>
  +save(entity: Entity): Entity
}
```

### SQL Tables

D2 renders structured data as SQL table diagrams:

```d2
users: {
  shape: sql_table
  
  id: int {constraint: primary_key}
  username: varchar(50)
  email: varchar(100)
  created_at: timestamp
}

posts: {
  shape: sql_table
  
  id: int {constraint: primary_key}
  user_id: int {constraint: foreign_key}
  title: text
  content: text
}

posts.user_id -> users.id
```

### Grid Diagrams

Grid layouts organize shapes in tabular formations for structured presentations.[4]

## Programmatic API (d2oracle)

D2 provides a comprehensive Go API for programmatic diagram generation through the d2oracle package. This API operates on D2's Abstract Syntax Tree, enabling high-level manipulation without direct AST node manipulation.[17][8]

### Core API Principles

All d2oracle functions are pure, returning new graph instances rather than mutating existing ones:[17]

```go
import "oss.terrastruct.com/d2/d2oracle"
```

### Create Operation

Creates shapes or connections with automatic parent container creation:

```go
newG, newKey, err := d2oracle.Create(
    graph,           // *d2graph.Graph
    nil,            // boardPath (nil for single-board diagrams)
    "aws.ec2.instance1"  // key
)
```

If shapes don't exist in a connection creation, they're automatically created. Duplicate shape IDs append a counter; duplicate connection IDs create multiple edges.[17]

### Set Operation

Sets attributes on existing shapes or connections:

```go
// Set shape attribute
shape := "cylinder"
newG, err := d2oracle.Set(
    graph,
    nil,
    "database.shape",
    nil,    // language tag
    &shape
)

// Set primary value (label)
label := "Production Database"
newG, err = d2oracle.Set(
    graph,
    nil,
    "database",
    nil,
    &label
)

// Unset attribute
newG, err = d2oracle.Set(
    graph,
    nil,
    "database.tooltip",
    nil,
    nil  // nil value unsets
)
```

Connections are targeted with index notation.[17]

### Delete Operation

Deletes shapes or connections, cascading to children:

```go
newG, err := d2oracle.Delete(
    graph,
    nil,
    "container.shape1"
)
```

Deleting a container removes all nested children.[17]

### Rename Operation

Changes object identifiers, updating all references:

```go
newG, err := d2oracle.Rename(
    graph,
    nil,
    "oldName",
    "newName"
)
```

Note: Rename changes IDs, not labels. Use Set for label changes.[17]

### Move Operation

Relocates shapes across containers:

```go
newG, err := d2oracle.Move(
    graph,
    nil,
    "netflix.movie",
    "hulu.movie"
)
```

If source and destination are in the same scope, Move behaves like Rename.[17]

### ID Delta Tracking

For applications maintaining external state, delta methods track all ID changes from operations affecting multiple objects:

```go
deltas, err := d2oracle.MoveIDDeltas(
    graph,
    nil,
    "x",
    "y.x"
)
// deltas: map[string]string of ID changes
```

Available delta methods: MoveIDDeltas, DeleteIDDeltas, RenameIDDeltas.[17]

### Practical Example: SQL Schema Visualization

The following demonstrates programmatic diagram generation by parsing SQL statements:

```go
func (q Query) transformGraph(g *d2graph.Graph) *d2graph.Graph {
    switch q.Command {
    case "create_table":
        newG, newKey, _ := d2oracle.Create(g, q.Table)
        shape := "sql_table"
        newG, _ = d2oracle.Set(g, fmt.Sprintf("%s.shape", newKey), nil, &shape)
        return newG
        
    case "add_column":
        newG, _ := d2oracle.Set(
            g,
            fmt.Sprintf("%s.%s", q.Table, q.Column),
            nil,
            &q.Type
        )
        return newG
        
    case "add_foreign_key":
        newG, _, _ := d2oracle.Create(
            g,
            fmt.Sprintf("%s.%s -> %s.%s",
                q.Table, q.Column,
                q.ForeignTable, q.ForeignColumn
            )
        )
        return newG
    }
    return nil
}
```

This approach transforms SQL DDL statements into visual schema diagrams programmatically.[8]

## Themes and Visual Customization

D2 includes professionally designed themes suitable for blogs, wikis, presentations, and documentation.[12][4]

### Theme Application

**CLI:**
```bash
d2 --theme=1 input.d2 output.svg
d2 -t 200 input.d2 output.png
```

**Environment Variable:**
```bash
D2_THEME=1 d2 input.d2 output.svg
```

**List Available Themes:**
```bash
d2 list-themes
```

### Theme Examples

Notable themes include:
- Default (neutral, professional)
- Mixed Berry Blue
- Vanilla Nitro Cola
- Grape Soda
- Terminal (special theme with caps lock, monospace, no border radius, dot patterns)

### Adaptive Dark Mode

D2 supports system preference-aware dark mode:

```bash
d2 --dark-theme=100 input.d2 output.svg
```

**Environment Variable:**
```bash
D2_DARK_THEME=100 d2 input.d2 output.svg
```

Generated SVGs automatically switch between light and dark themes based on user system preferences when embedded in web pages.[12]

### Theme Overrides

Customize existing themes or create custom themes via configuration variables:

```d2
vars: {
  theme-overrides: {
    B1: "#ffffff"
    B2: "#f0f0f0"
    AA2: "#333333"
  }
  
  dark-theme-overrides: {
    B1: "#1a1a1a"
    B2: "#2d2d2d"
    AA2: "#ffffff"
  }
}
```

Theme override color codes control various diagram elements, with extensibility for future features.[12]

### Special Themes

Certain themes modify rendering behavior beyond colors. The Terminal theme applies:
- Uppercase labels by default
- Zero border radius
- Monospaced fonts
- Dot fill patterns for containers
- Double borders on outer containers

These defaults can still be overridden through explicit styling.[12]

## Export Formats and Output Options

D2 compiles to multiple output formats suitable for different use cases:[6][4]

**SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):**
```bash
d2 input.d2 output.svg
```
Ideal for web embedding, infinite scalability, smallest file size, supports interactivity (links, tooltips).

**PNG (Raster Image):**
```bash
d2 input.d2 output.png
```
Suitable for presentations, documentation, when vector format is not supported.

**PDF (Portable Document Format):**
```bash
d2 input.d2 output.pdf
```
Professional documentation, print materials, archival purposes.

**HTML:**
```bash
d2 input.d2 output.html
```
Self-contained interactive diagrams with embedded JavaScript.

## Integration and Extensions

### Astro Integration (astro-d2)

For Astro-based documentation sites like Starlight, the astro-d2 integration transforms D2 code blocks into rendered diagrams during build:

```bash
npm install astro-d2
```

```javascript
// astro.config.mjs
import d2 from 'astro-d2';

export default {
  integrations: [d2()]
}
```

Markdown usage:
````markdown
```
users -> api -> database
```
```

The integration supports global configuration and per-diagram attributes.[9]

**Deployment Considerations:**
D2 CLI must be available in the deployment environment, or use the `skipGeneration` option to pre-build diagrams locally and commit them.[9]

### Community Extensions

D2's extension ecosystem includes plugins for various platforms and frameworks, accessible through official documentation.[4]

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Language Support

D2 supports Unicode, enabling diagrams in English, Chinese, French, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and even emoji-based diagrams:[4]

```d2
用户 -> API -> 数据库
```

### Icons and Images

Import external images and icons:

```d2
server: {
  icon: https://icons.example.com/server.svg
}

logo: {
  image: https://example.com/logo.png
}
```

### Animations

Create animated diagrams showing state transitions or processes:

```d2
scenarios: {
  start: {
    a
    b
  }
  
  step1: {
    a -> b
  }
  
  step2: {
    a -> b: "processing"
    b.style.fill: blue
  }
}
```

Export with animation:
```bash
d2 --animate input.d2 output.svg
```

### Composite Shapes

D2 supports nested structures enabling complex architectural representations:

```d2
datacenter: {
  rack1: {
    server1
    server2
    server3
  }
  
  rack2: {
    server4
    server5
  }
  
  network: {
    switch1
    switch2
  }
}
```

## Configuration Management

### TOML Configuration Files

Project-wide defaults can be specified via TOML configuration:

```toml
# d2-config.toml
theme = 1
dark-theme = 100
layout = "elk"
pad = 20
sketch = false
font = "Inter"
```

Usage:
```bash
d2 --config d2-config.toml input.d2 output.svg
```

### Precedence Hierarchy

Configuration precedence from highest to lowest:
1. Command-line flags
2. Environment variables
3. Configuration file
4. In-file vars.d2-config
5. Default values

This hierarchy enables flexible configuration strategies from global defaults to per-diagram overrides.[10]

## Best Practices and Workflow

### Development Workflow

1. **Initial Creation:** Use watch mode for interactive development
```bash
d2 --watch diagram.d2
```

2. **Iteration:** Edit source file, browser automatically refreshes

3. **Refinement:** Apply themes, layouts, and styling

4. **Export:** Generate final output in required format

### Modular Design

Organize complex diagrams using imports:

```
project/
  diagrams/
    main.d2
    components/
      network.d2
      services.d2
      database.d2
```

```d2
# main.d2
...@components/network
...@components/services
...@components/database
```

### Version Control

D2 source files are plain text, enabling effective version control:
- Track .d2 files in Git
- Review changes through text diffs
- Collaborate via pull requests
- Optional: commit rendered outputs for documentation

### Performance Optimization

- Use appropriate layout engine for diagram type
- Minimize unnecessary nesting
- Leverage imports for large diagrams
- Consider TALA for complex architectural diagrams requiring precise control

## System Requirements and Dependencies

D2 is written in Go and distributed as platform-specific binaries, eliminating runtime dependencies. The compiled CLI is self-contained, requiring only:[3]
- Operating system: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- For Go installation method: Go 1.19 or later

No additional runtime environments, interpreters, or libraries are required for basic operation.[1][3]

D2 represents a comprehensive solution for declarative diagramming, combining simplicity of text-based authoring with professional rendering quality, extensive customization options, programmatic generation capabilities, and robust tooling integration suitable for modern technical documentation and software architecture visualization workflows.[2][8][1][4]
