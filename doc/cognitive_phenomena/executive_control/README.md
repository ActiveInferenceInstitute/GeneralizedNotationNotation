# Executive Control in Active Inference

## Overview

Executive control in Active Inference emerges from hierarchical precision optimization and policy selection. Rather than being a separate cognitive system, executive control represents the brain's capacity to flexibly allocate precision and select appropriate behavioral policies based on goals, context, and anticipated outcomes.

## Core Mechanisms

### Hierarchical Policy Control
Executive functions operate through hierarchical control of lower-level cognitive processes by modulating precision weights and biasing policy selection toward goal-relevant actions.

### Context-Sensitive Precision Allocation
Executive control involves the dynamic allocation of precision (inverse variance) to different aspects of cognition based on task demands, goals, and environmental context.

### Predictive Resource Management
Executive control anticipates future cognitive demands and pre-allocates computational resources to optimize performance across multiple timescales and competing objectives.

## Key Executive Functions

### Working Memory
**Function**: Active maintenance and manipulation of information
**Mechanism**: Sustained high-precision representations resistant to decay and interference
**Neural Basis**: Prefrontal cortex recurrent networks
**Disorders**: ADHD, schizophrenia, aging

### Cognitive Flexibility
**Function**: Switching between mental sets, tasks, or strategies
**Mechanism**: Rapid reconfiguration of precision allocation and policy priors
**Neural Basis**: Anterior cingulate, prefrontal cortex
**Disorders**: Autism, OCD, frontal lobe lesions

### Inhibitory Control
**Function**: Suppression of inappropriate responses or thoughts
**Mechanism**: Precision reduction for irrelevant information and competing responses
**Neural Basis**: Right inferior frontal gyrus, subthalamic nucleus
**Disorders**: ADHD, impulse control disorders

### Planning and Decision Making
**Function**: Sequential action selection to achieve long-term goals
**Mechanism**: Tree search through policy space using expected free energy
**Neural Basis**: Prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia
**Disorders**: Frontal dementia, depression

## Computational Models

### Executive Control as Precision Optimization
```
Executive_Control = Hierarchical_Precision_Allocation(Goals, Context, Resources)
Precision_Allocation = f(Task_Relevance, Goal_Importance, Cognitive_Capacity)
```

### Policy Selection and Control
```
Policy_Selection = argmin(Expected_Free_Energy + Control_Cost)
Expected_Free_Energy = Pragmatic_Value + Epistemic_Value
Control_Cost = Precision_Cost + Switching_Cost
```

### Resource Allocation
```
Resource_Allocation = Optimize(Performance, Effort, Sustainability)
Cognitive_Load = sum(Precision_Weights × Processing_Demands)
```
