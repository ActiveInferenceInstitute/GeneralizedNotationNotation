# Perception in Active Inference

## Overview

Perception in Active Inference is fundamentally predictive - it emerges from the brain's continuous process of generating predictions about sensory input and updating these predictions based on prediction errors. Rather than passive reception of information, perception is an active process of hypothesis testing and model updating.

## Core Mechanisms

### Predictive Processing
The brain maintains hierarchical generative models that predict sensory input at multiple levels of abstraction. Perception emerges from the minimization of prediction error across this hierarchy.

### Precision-Weighted Prediction Error
Not all prediction errors are treated equally. The brain dynamically adjusts the precision (inverse variance) of prediction errors, giving more weight to reliable signals and less to noisy or irrelevant information.

### Active Sampling
Perception involves active exploration of the environment through eye movements, head turns, and other behaviors that test perceptual hypotheses and reduce uncertainty.

## Key Phenomena

### Basic Perceptual Processes

#### Object Recognition
- **Template Matching**: Comparison of input with stored representations
- **Feature Integration**: Binding of features into coherent object representations
- **Invariance**: Recognition despite changes in viewpoint, lighting, or scale
- **Categorical Perception**: Sharp boundaries between perceptual categories

#### Depth and Spatial Perception
- **Binocular Disparity**: Stereoscopic depth perception
- **Motion Parallax**: Depth from relative motion
- **Perspective Cues**: Linear and atmospheric perspective
- **Size Constancy**: Stable size perception despite distance changes

#### Motion Perception
- **Apparent Motion**: Perception of motion from discrete frames
- **Biological Motion**: Recognition of living beings from motion patterns
- **Optic Flow**: Perception of self-motion through environment
- **Motion Segmentation**: Separating objects based on motion

### Perceptual Illusions and Ambiguity

#### Visual Illusions
- **Müller-Lyer Illusion**: Line length misperception due to arrowheads
- **Kanizsa Triangle**: Illusory contours and shapes
- **Color Constancy**: Stable color perception despite illumination changes
- **Size Illusions**: Ebbinghaus, Ponzo, and related phenomena

#### Ambiguous Figures
- **Necker Cube**: Bistable perception of 3D orientation
- **Rubin's Vase**: Figure-ground reversals
- **Spinning Dancer**: Ambiguous rotation direction
- **Bistable Motion**: Multiple interpretations of moving patterns

#### Change Blindness and Inattentional Blindness
- **Change Blindness**: Failure to notice large changes during interruption
- **Inattentional Blindness**: Missing salient stimuli when attention is focused elsewhere
- **Banner Blindness**: Ignoring expected but irrelevant information

### Multisensory Integration

#### Cross-Modal Plasticity
- **Visual-Auditory Integration**: Temporal and spatial correspondence
- **McGurk Effect**: Speech perception influenced by visual lip movements
- **Rubber Hand Illusion**: Illusory ownership of fake limbs
- **Ventriloquist Effect**: Mislocalization of sound sources

#### Sensory Substitution
- **Tactile-Visual**: Converting visual information to touch
- **Auditory-Visual**: Converting visual information to sound
- **Neural Plasticity**: Adaptation to new sensory mappings

## Computational Models

### Hierarchical Predictive Coding
```
Prediction_Error(level) = Sensory_Input(level) - Prediction(level)
Prediction(level) = f(Beliefs(level+1), Context(level))
Belief_Update = Learning_Rate × Precision × Prediction_Error
```

### Precision Optimization
```
Precision(signal) = f(Reliability, Attention, Context, Prior_Experience)
Effective_Error = Precision × Prediction_Error
```

### Bayesian Perceptual Inference
```
Posterior_Belief = Prior_Belief × Likelihood / Evidence
Likelihood = P(Sensory_Data | Perceptual_Hypothesis)
Prior = P(Perceptual_Hypothesis | Context, Experience)
```

## Clinical Applications

### Perceptual Disorders

#### Schizophrenia
- **Hallucinations**: False perceptions without external stimuli
- **Perceptual Anomalies**: Altered salience and precision of sensory processing
- **Reality Monitoring**: Difficulty distinguishing internal from external sources

#### Autism Spectrum Disorders
- **Sensory Hypersensitivity**: Enhanced precision for certain sensory modalities
- **Weak Central Coherence**: Focus on details rather than global patterns
- **Atypical Sensory Integration**: Altered multisensory processing

#### Visual Agnosia
- **Object Agnosia**: Inability to recognize objects despite intact vision
- **Prosopagnosia**: Specific deficit in face recognition
- **Motion Blindness**: Inability to perceive motion (akinetopsia)

#### Phantom Limb Syndrome
- **Phantom Sensations**: Continued perception of amputated limbs
- **Phantom Pain**: Painful sensations in missing limbs
- **Body Schema**: Disrupted internal model of body structure
