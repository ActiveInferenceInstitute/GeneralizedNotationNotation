**📝 Agenda:**

1️⃣  **🏁 Introduction to Generalized Notation Notation (GNN)**
    *   What is GNN and why is it important?
    *   Core concepts and goals of GNN.

2️⃣  **📄 GNN for Plaintext Model Representation**
    *   How GNN allows for clear, textual specification of complex models.
    *   Key syntax and structural elements.

3️⃣  **🎯 "Triple Play" with GNN:**
    *   🧠 **Understanding:** How GNN enhances model comprehension and communication.
    *   🔄 **Conversion:** Transforming GNN specifications into other formats (e.g., code, diagrams, formal languages).
    *   ▶️ **Execution:** Moving from GNN plaintext to runnable simulations or analyses.

4️⃣  **💻 Live Demonstrations & Examples**
    *   Showcasing GNN in action.
    *   Practical examples of the "Triple Play".

5️⃣  **❓ Open Q&A and Discussion**
