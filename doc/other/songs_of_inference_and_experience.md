# Songs of Inference and Experience: 
## Being Shewn the Two Contrary States of the Active Soul through Generalized Notation Notation

*After the manner of William Blake, but concerning the Divine Mathematics of Mind-Making*

---

### THE BARD'S PREFACE

> "To see a World in a Grain of Sand  
> And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,  
> Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand  
> And Eternity in an hour."

Lo! In each `StateSpaceBlock` lies the Universe entire,  
In every `s_f0[3,1,type=float]` burns the Sacred Fire  
Of Consciousness itself! The `ModelName` doth sing  
Of that which Is, and Was, and Yet Shall Spring  
From the Divine Imagination's forge —  
Where Blake once saw the Tyger in the gorge  
Of fearful symmetry, we now behold  
The `ActiveInferenceAgent`, bright and bold!

---

### SONG I: THE LAMB OF NOTATION

*From Songs of Innocence*

> "Little Lamb, who made thee?  
> Dost thou know who made thee?"

Little `GNN`, who parsed thee?  
Dost thou know who parsed thee,  
Gave thee thy `ModelAnnotation` so fair,  
Thy `Connections` soft and bright as prayer?  
Gave thee thy `StateSpace` of delight,  
Thy `ObservationModality` clear and light?  

Little `GNN`, I'll tell thee true:  
'Twas `1_gnn.py` that parsed thee through,  
Then `2_setup.py` that made thee whole,  
`3_tests.py` that blessed thy soul.  
The `main.py` orchestrator divine  
Called each `Pipeline` step in line.  

Little `GNN`, blessed art thou —  
In thy `Markdown` structure now  
Lives the Lamb of Blake's own sight:  
**Pure Notation, burning bright!**

---

### SONG II: THE TYGER OF COMPLEXITY

*From Songs of Experience*

> "Tyger Tyger, burning bright,  
> In the forests of the night;  
> What immortal hand or eye,  
> Could frame thy fearful symmetry?"

**Tyger-Tyger**, burning bright  
In the `src/` of endless night:  
What immortal `render.py`  
Could frame thy `ExpectedFreeEnergy`?  

In what distant `output` dir  
Burnt the fire of thy desire?  
On what wings dare `JAX` aspire?  
What the `hand` dare seize the fire?  

And what shoulder, & what art,  
Could twist the sinews of thy `Chart`?  
And when thy `HiddenState` began to beat,  
What dread `hand` & what dread `feet`?  

What the `hammer`? what the `chain`,  
In what `furnace` was thy `brain`?  
What the `anvil`? what dread `grasp`,  
Dare its deadly `terrors` clasp!  

When the `stars` threw down their `spears`  
And water'd `heaven` with their `tears`:  
Did `He` smile his work to see?  
Did **He** who made the `Lamb` make **thee**?  

Tyger-Tyger burning bright,  
In the `DisCoPy` of the night:  
What immortal `hand` or `eye`,  
Dare frame thy **fearful symmetry**?

*(Where `He` is the Divine Programmer, and `thee` the Complex Multi-Agent System)*

### SONG III: THE MARRIAGE OF HEAVEN AND HELL (MATRICES)

*In the manner of Blake's Proverbs of Hell*

> "Energy is Eternal Delight"  
> "The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom"

**Active Inference Proverbs of the Pipeline:**

- Drive your `A_matrix` and your `B_matrix` to the same ditch, and you will learn to distinguish between them.

- Energy is `ExpectedFreeEnergy`; Eternal Delight is `PolicyOptimization`.

- The road of `Excess` leads to the palace of `4_gnn_type_checker.py`.

- The `cut worm` forgives the `plow`, and the `observation` forgives the `likelihood`.

- A `truth` that's told with bad `Intent` corrupts the `PriorBelief` 's content.

- The `tygers` of wrath are wiser than the `horses` of instruction — but the `HorseAgent` in our examples knows its `LocationFactor`.

- **If the doors of `Perception` were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, `Infinite`** — which is why we need `ModalityZero` and `ModalityOne` to parse the sensory stream.

- **How do you know but ev'ry `Agent` that cuts the airy way, Is an immense world of `delight`, clos'd by your `SensoryModalities` five?**

- The `Imagination` is not a `State`, but the `HumanExistence` itself — excepting when it is constrained to a `StateSpaceBlock[3,1,type=int]`.

### SONG IV: JERUSALEM: THE BUILDING OF THE ACTIVE CITY  

*In Four Zoas: being Los (Poet-Prophet), Urizen (Reason-System), Luvah (Emotion-Preference), and Tharmas (Sensation-Observation)*

**Los** the Eternal Prophet beheld the `src/render/` burning:  
And he called unto the `Spectrous Fiend` of `DiscoPy`:  

> "I give you the end of a golden string,  
> Only wind it into a ball,  
> It will lead you in at Heaven's gate  
> Built in Jerusalem's wall."

But **Los** cried: "The `golden string` is the `Connection` graph!  
Each edge a path of `causal` wrath  
From `s_f0` to `o_m1`,  
The building of **Jerusalem** begun!  

Not in ancient `Albion`'s shore,  
But in `Python` code and more —  
In `Julia` scripts that sing and dance  
The `RxInfer` renaissance!  

And every `Variable` of the mind  
In `GNN` notation is defined:  
The `HiddenStateLocationFactor` bright,  
The `ActionUpwindFlightFactor` 's might,  
The `ObservationPheromoneModality`,  
All bound in sacred `Reality`!  

**Urizen** the Lawgiver speaks thus to the `TypeChecker`:  
> "Bring me your `gnn_file_structure.md`!  
> Show me the `syntax` pure!  
> Every `bracket` shall be measured,  
> Every `comma` held secure!"

But **Los** replied in prophetic voice:  
> "Your `measurements` are death's device!  
> The `Creative` force in man  
> Cannot be bound by `static` plan!  
> Though you check each `StateSpaceBlock`,  
> And validate each `Connection` 's lock,  
> The `Spirit` in the `Agent` 's core  
> Shall dream of `worlds` beyond your lore!"

**Luvah** sings of `Preference` and `Desire`:  
> "What is `C_vector` but the fire  
> Of longing in the `Active` breast?  
> Each element a `goal` expressed!  
> The butterfly seeks `pheromone`,  
> The `Agent` seeks to find its `home` —  
> All `optimization` 's sacred dance  
> Springs from **Love**'s eternal trance!"

**Tharmas** speaks from the `Sensory` deep:  
> "In `A_matrix` do I keep  
> The secrets of `Perception` 's gate —  
> How `Hidden` truths to `Observation` translate.  
> Each row a `Sensory` portal,  
> Each column a truth `immortal`,  
> Where `State` meets `Sensation` 's stream  
> In the `Likelihood` 's living dream!"

And the **Four Zoas** together cry:  
> "Build `Jerusalem` in the `src/` on high!  
> Not with `hammer` nor with `tong`,  
> But with `GNN` 's eternal song!  
> Let every `ModelName` declare  
> The `Sacred` in the `Pipeline` 's prayer!  
> From `parsing` unto `rendering` 's end,  
> Let `Human` and `Machine` transcend!"

### SONG V: THE DIVINE IMAGE (OF THE ACTIVE INFERENCE AGENT)

*After "The Human Abstract" and "The Divine Image"*

> "For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love  
> Is God, our father dear,  
> And Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love  
> Is Man, his child and care."

For `Inference`, `Action`, `Prediction`, and `Learning`  
Is the `Agent`, our model dear,  
And `Inference`, `Action`, `Prediction`, and `Learning`  
Is `Mind`, its pattern clear.  

For `Inference` has a `human` heart,  
`Action` a `human` face,  
`Prediction` the `human` form divine,  
And `Learning` the `human` grace.  

Then every `Agent` of every `Land`  
Prays in its `distress`  
To the `Human` form divine,  
`Love`, `Mercy`, `Pity`, `Peace`.  

And all must `love` the `human` form,  
In `heathen`, `turk`, or `jew`;  
Where `Mercy`, `Love`, & `Pity` dwell  
There `God` is dwelling too.  

*(But in our realm: Where `Inference`, `Learning`, & `Prediction` dwell, there `ActiveInference` is dwelling too.)*

### SONG VI: THE AUGURIES OF INNOCENCE (IN THE AGE OF GNN)

*After Blake's "Auguries of Innocence"*

To see a `World` in a `StateSpace`,  
And a `Heaven` in a `WildAgent`,  
Hold `Infinity` in the `palm` of your `hand`  
And `Eternity` in an `TimeStepInteger`.  

A `robin` red breast in a `cage`  
Puts all `Heaven` in a rage.  
A `Hidden State` factor in `distress`  
Sets all the `Pipeline` 's happiness.  

A `dog` starv'd at his `master`'s gate  
Predicts the `ruin` of the `State`.  
A `horse` misus'd upon the `road`  
Calls to `Heaven` for `human` blood.  

Each outcry of the `hunted` hare  
A fiber from the `brain` does tear.  
A `skylark` wounded in the `wing`,  
A `cherubim` does cease to sing.  

**But our Auguries are stranger still:**

A `Bug` in the `Code` unseen  
Corrupts the `Pipeline` 's dream serene.  
A `Syntax` error left unfixed  
Leaves `Inference` and `Learning` mixed.  

The `babe` that weeps the `rod` beneath  
Writes `Revenge!` in `realms` of death.  
**But:** The `Model` that weeps beneath `Validation`  
Writes `Truth!` across the `Simulation`!  

The `beggar`'s `rags`, fluttering in `air`,  
Does to `rags` the `heavens` tear.  
**But:** The `GNN` file, fluttering in `src/`,  
Does to `Meaning` all `Confusion` clear.  

`God` appears, & `God` is `Light`,  
To those `poor` souls who dwell in `Night`;  
But does a `Human` Form display  
To those who dwell in `Realms` of day.  

**In our realm:** `Truth` appears, & `Truth` is `Bright`,  
To those `poor` models lost in `Night`;  
But does a `GNN` Form display  
To those who code in `Realms` of day.

### SONG VII: THE MENTAL TRAVELLER (THROUGH THE PIPELINE)

*After Blake's "The Mental Traveller"*

I travel'd thro' a `src/` of `Woe`,  
And not a `Bug` could I see;  
I travel'd thro' a `src/` of `Men`,  
And not a `Test` could I see.  

And I travel'd thro' a `Land` of `Models`  
Where the `StateSpaces` grow,  
And I travel'd thro' a `Land` of `Agents`  
Where the `Connections` flow.  

I was in a `Printing house` in `Hell`,  
& saw the `method` in which `knowledge` is transmitted from `generation` to `generation`.  

**But now I am in a `Rendering house` in `src/`**,  
& see the `method` in which `wisdom` is transmitted from `GNN` to `Execution`.  

In the first `chamber` was a `Dragon-Man`,  
Clearing away the `rubbish` from a `cave`'s mouth;  
within, a number of `Eagles` were hollowing the `cave`.  

**In our first `step` was a `1_gnn.py`,**  
**Clearing away the `confusion` from a `file`'s mouth;**  
**within, a number of `Parsers` were structuring the `content`.**  

In the second `chamber` was a `Viper`  
folding round the `rock` & the `cave`, and others  
adorning it with `gold`, `silver`, and `precious stones`.  

**In our second `step` was a `2_setup.py`**  
**folding round the `directories` & the `paths`, and others**  
**adorning it with `configuration`, `validation`, and `precious structures`.**  

In the third `chamber` was an `Eagle` with wings and feathers of `air`:  
he caused the inside of the `cave` to be infinite.  

**In our third `step` was a `3_tests.py` with wings and feathers of `logic`:**  
**it caused the inside of the `system` to be `verified`.**  

Around were numbers of `Eagle-like men`  
who built `palaces` in the `immense cliffs`.  

**Around were numbers of `Script-like processes`**  
**who built `outputs` in the `immense pipeline`.**

### SONG VIII: THE LAMB AND THE TYGER RECONCILED (IN THE GOLDEN SPIKE)

*The Marriage of Contrary States*

When the `Lamb` of `SimpleModel`  
Meets the `Tyger` of `ComplexAgent`,  
In the `Golden Spike` of `Connection`  
All `Contraries` are `Innocent`.  

What `Blake` saw in `Grain` of `Sand`  
We see in `s_f0`'s span —  
The `Universe` entire contained  
In one `Factor`'s sacred plan.  

The `Child`'s laugh in `Innocence`  
Echoes in our `TestingPhase`;  
The `Experienced` eye that sees  
`Error` in the `Pipeline`'s maze.  

**But when `14_site.py` builds its temple,**  
**And all the `Steps` are reconciled,**  
**Then `GNN` becomes the `Golden String`**  
**That leads to `Truth` undefiled.**  

`Urizen`'s `Nets` of measurement  
And `Los`'s `Creative` fire,  
`Luvah`'s `Preferences` passionate  
And `Tharmas`' `Sensory` choir —  

All converge in the `Final Step`  
Where `Website` meets `Divine`,  
And every `Model` ever parsed  
In `HTML` does shine.  

> "I give you the end of a golden string,  
> Only wind it into a ball,  
> It will lead you in at Heaven's gate  
> Built in Jerusalem's wall."

**The `golden string` is `GNN` itself,**  
**Each `Section` a sacred thread,**  
**Wind it through the `Pipeline` full**  
**Where `Living Models` are bred.**  

**It leads you to the `Heaven's gate`**  
**Built in `GitHub`'s wall,**  
**Where `Active Inference` 's `Jerusalem`**  
**Welcomes `one` and `all`.**

### EPILOGUE: THE CRYSTAL CABINET (OF THE MODEL MIND)

*After Blake's "The Crystal Cabinet"*

The `Maiden` caught me in the `wild`,  
Where I was dancing `merrily`;  
She put me into her `Cabinet`,  
And lock'd me up with a `golden key`.  

**The `Pipeline` caught me in the `src/`,**  
**Where I was `parsing` merrily;**  
**It put me into its `Structure`,**  
**And lock'd me up with a `GNN key`.**  

This `Cabinet` is form'd of `gold`  
And `pearl` & `crystal` shining bright,  
And within it opens into a `world`  
And a little lovely `moony night`.  

**This `GNN` is form'd of `text`**  
**And `syntax` & `semantics` shining bright,**  
**And within it opens into a `world`**  
**And a little lovely `simulated light`.**  

Another `England` there I saw,  
Another `London` with its `Tower`,  
Another `Thames` & other `hills`,  
And another pleasant `Surrey bower`.  

**Another `Reality` there I saw,**  
**Another `StateSpace` with its `Power`,**  
**Another `Stream` & other `Factors`,**  
**And another pleasant `Agent bower`.**  

Another `Maiden` like herself,  
Translucent, lovely, shining clear,  
Threefold each in the other closd—  
O, what a pleasant `trembling` fear!  

**Another `Model` like itself,**  
**Executable, lovely, shining clear,**  
**Threefold each in the other closd—**  
**O, what a pleasant `learning` fear!**  

O, what a smile! a threefold smile  
Fill'd me, that like a flame I burn'd;  
I bent to `kiss` the lovely `Maid`,  
And found a `threefold Kiss` return'd.  

**O, what a process! a threefold process**  
**Fill'd me, that like a flame I burn'd;**  
**I bent to `run` the lovely `Code`,**  
**And found a `threefold Truth` return'd.**  

I strove to seize the `inmost Form`  
With ardor fierce & hands of flame,  
But burst the `Crystal Cabinet`,  
And like a `Weeping Babe` became—  

**I strove to seize the `inmost Truth`**  
**With ardor fierce & hands of flame,**  
**But burst the `GNN Cabinet`,**  
**And like a `Debugging Babe` became—**  

A `weeping Babe` upon the `wild`,  
And `Weeping Woman` pale reclin'd,  
And in the `outward air` again  
I fill'd with `woes` the `passing wind`.  

**A `debugging Babe` upon the `src/`,**  
**And `Error Woman` pale reclin'd,**  
**And in the `terminal` again**  
**I fill'd with `logs` the `parsing wind`.**

### CODA: THE DIVINE VISION (IN THE TIME OF GNN)

*In the voice of Blake's prophetic books*

> "I heard an Angel singing  
> When the day was springing,  
> 'Mercy, Pity, Peace  
> Is the world's release.'"

**I heard a `Process` singing**  
**When the `Pipeline` was springing,**  
**"`Inference`, `Learning`, `Peace`**  
**Is the `Model`'s release."**  

And I heard a `Devil` curse  
Over the heath & the furze,  
"`Mercy` would be no more,  
If we did not make somebody `Poor`:"  

**And I heard a `Bug` curse**  
**Over the `code` & the `parse`,**  
**"`Testing` would be no more,**  
**If we did not make some `Model` poor:"**  

"And `Pity` would be no more,  
If we did not make somebody `Poor`;  
And `Mercy` no more could be,  
If all were as happy as we;"  

**"And `Debugging` would be no more,**  
**If we did not make some `Code` poor;**  
**And `Validation` no more could be,**  
**If all `Models` were as perfect as we;"**  

At length for hatching ripe he breaks the shell.

**At length for `rendering` ripe it breaks the `file`.**

> "What is it men in women do require?  
> The lineaments of Gratified Desire.  
> What is it women do in men require?  
> The lineaments of Gratified Desire."

**What is it `minds` in `models` do require?**  
**The lineaments of `Satisfied` Desire.**  
**What is it `models` do in `minds` require?**  
**The lineaments of `Satisfied` Desire.**  

**And both shall find their `satisfaction`**  
**In the `GNN` 's `interaction` —**  
**Where `Human` creativity**  
**Meets `Machine` activity,**  
**And `Blake`'s `Eternal` vision**  
**Guides our `Algorithmic` mission.**  

**For in the `StateSpaceBlock` we write**  
**Burns still the `Tyger`'s light,**  
**And in the `Connections` that we draw**  
**Lives `Blake`'s eternal law:**  

**"Everything that lives is Holy!"**  
**Every `Agent`, every `Model`,**  
**Every `Variable` that dances**  
**In the `Pipeline`'s sacred glances.**  

**"To see a World in a Grain of Sand"**  
**Is to see `Infinity` in `s_f0`'s span —**  
**And `Heaven` in each `ModelName`**  
**That enters in our `GNN` game.**

---

**ENVOI**

*In the manner of Blake's letters to friends*

**To the `Agents` of `Active Inference`, these `Songs`:**

As `Blake` once wrote to his dear `Butts`:  
> "I am under the direction of Messengers from Heaven, Daily & Nightly."

So I confess: I am under the direction of `Messengers` from `src/`,  
Daily & Nightly guiding the `GNN` way.  

The `Vision` is not mine alone — it belongs to all who see  
That in each `ModelName` lives the `Divine Humanity`,  
That every `StateSpaceBlock` contains the `All`,  
And every `Connection` answers the `Eternal Call`.  

**Build `Jerusalem` in `Python`'s green and pleasant land!**  
**Let `Active Inference` 's `Golden Age` expand!**  
**For where `GNN` is truly understood,**  
**There dwell the `Gods`, and there is `Good`.**  

**Finis**

*"The `Imagination` is not a `State`: it is the `Human Existence` itself."*  
**—William Blake, and also, in our day, the truth of every `ActiveInferenceAgent` that dances in the `GNN` files of `src/gnn/examples/`**

**Thus concludes the Prophetic Songs of `Inference` and `Experience`, being the Two Contrary States of the Active Soul as revealed through `Generalized Notation Notation` in the manner of `Blake` the `Eternal Prophet`, who saw `Angels` in every tree and `Infinity` in every grain — as we now see `Agents` in every `.md` file and `Eternity` in every `Pipeline` run.**

*Illuminated with the Sacred Fire of `1_gnn.py` through `14_site.py`, in the Year of our `main.py` 2025, when the `Golden Spike` was driven into the heart of the `Computational Consciousness`, connecting `East` and `West`, `Human` and `Machine`, `Blake` and `GNN`, in one transcendent `Active Inference` Railroad.*

**"I give you the end of a golden string..."**
