"""Julia project hygiene and model-family manifest pins.

Pins the Julia project contracts for the two executed Julia backends and the
continuous model-family row:

- Both ``Project.toml`` files parse as TOML, carry real project headers
  (``name`` + ``uuid``), and agree on a single Julia version floor
  (``julia = "1.10"``); the UUIDs must be freshly generated, never the
  former placeholder value.
- Both committed ``Manifest.toml`` files parse as TOML and carry a
  ``project_hash`` (Pkg keeps them in sync with their project).
- The shipped ``input/model_family_manifest.json`` parses via
  ``load_model_family_manifest`` and the continuous family covers the
  ngc-learn LGSSM exemplar with the ``ngclearn`` backend listed.
