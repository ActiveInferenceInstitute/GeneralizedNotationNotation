"""Regression tests for the manuscript's *path* claims.

Every other manuscript check compares a **number** against the producer. A path
is not a number, which is how this defect shipped clean: a commit repointed the
``multiagent`` family's ``target_dir`` from ``input/multi_agent_models`` into
``input/gnn_files/multiagent``, and three prose sites went on describing the
pre-change layout. The counts beside them were all still correct, so
``check_manuscript_tokens.py --strict`` reported "clean" over the contradiction.

Two mechanisms close it, and these tests pin both:

* :func:`manuscript_variables.corpus_coverage_notes` generates the two sentences
  that state the family-to-directory relationship, so no manuscript file types
  it. Both branches are exercised here — the all-inside branch the repository is
  in today, and the some-outside branch it was in before.
* ``check_manuscript_tokens._path_claim_issues`` cross-checks any ``input/...``
  literal that prose does type against the manifest.

The live-repository test at the end is the one that would have failed on the
shipped PDF.
