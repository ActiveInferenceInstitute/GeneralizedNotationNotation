## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The GNN team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### Reporting Channels

**Primary Contact:**
- **Email**: Send an email to `blanket@activeinference.institute`
- **Subject Line**: Use "Security Vulnerability in GNN Project"

**GitHub Security:**
- **Platform**: [GitHub Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
- **Repository**: [GeneralizedNotationNotation](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/GeneralizedNotationNotation/security/advisories)
- **Benefits**: Automated coordination with dependency maintainers

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:

- **Clear description** of the vulnerability and its impact
- **Component identification**: Affected files, modules, or pipeline steps
- **Reproduction steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue  
- **Version information**: Affected GNN versions and dependencies
- **Environment details**: Operating system, Python version, framework versions
- **Proof of concept**: If applicable, demonstration code (safely)
- **Suggested mitigations**: If you have ideas for fixes

### Security-Specific Concerns

**LLM Integration Security** (Pipeline Step 11):
- API key exposure in configuration files
- Prompt injection attacks through GNN files  
- Unsafe code generation from LLM outputs

**MCP Security** (Pipeline Step 7):
- Model Context Protocol authentication issues
- Unsafe resource access patterns
- Data leakage through model context

**Pipeline Security** (All 13 Steps):
- Code injection through GNN file parsing
- Unsafe file operations in output generation
- Privilege escalation in execution steps

## üõ°Ô∏è Our Security Commitment

### Response Timeline

Once a security vulnerability is reported, we commit to:

**Immediate Response (24-48 hours):**
- Acknowledge receipt of the vulnerability report
- Assign a security team member as primary contact
- Begin initial assessment and triage

**Investigation Phase (1-7 days):**
- Validate and reproduce the vulnerability
- Assess severity using CVSS scoring
- Determine affected versions and components
- Develop initial mitigation strategies

**Resolution Phase (Variable, based on severity):**
- **Critical**: 24-72 hours for emergency patch
- **High**: 1-2 weeks for comprehensive fix
- **Medium**: 2-4 weeks for scheduled release
- **Low**: Next planned release cycle

**Disclosure Phase:**
- Coordinate responsible disclosure timeline
- Prepare security advisory and documentation
- Release patched versions across supported branches
- Publicly acknowledge contributor (unless requested otherwise)

### Security Integration

**Development Security:**
- All code changes reviewed for security implications
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline  
- Dependency vulnerability monitoring
- Regular security audits of critical components

**Documentation Security:**
- Security considerations in all operational guides
- Threat model documentation for each pipeline step
- Security configuration examples and best practices
- Incident response procedures and playbooks

## üîß Security Best Practices for Users

### Development Environment Security

**Environment Setup:**
- Use isolated Python virtual environments
- Keep dependencies updated: `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`
- Validate GNN file sources before processing
- Use secure API key storage (environment variables, not files)

**Code Security:**
- Review generated code before execution
- Validate all inputs to GNN parsers
- Use sandbox environments for testing unknown models
- Follow secure coding practices for extensions

### Production Deployment Security

**Infrastructure Security:**
- Deploy with minimal required privileges
- Use encrypted connections for all API calls
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Regular security updates and patches

**Configuration Security:**
- Secure API key management (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Network segmentation for GNN processing
- Input validation for all user-provided GNN files
- Output sanitization for generated code

### Framework-Specific Security

**PyMDP Security:**
- Validate matrix dimensions before processing
- Sanitize numerical inputs for stability
- Monitor memory usage for large state spaces

**RxInfer.jl Security:**  
- Validate Julia code generation outputs
- Secure inter-process communication with Julia
- Monitor computational resource usage

**ActiveInference.jl Security:**
- Validate Julia ActiveInference.jl code generation outputs
- Secure inter-process communication with Julia
- Monitor computational resource usage for ActiveInference.jl simulations

**LLM Integration Security:**
- Never include sensitive data in prompts
- Validate all LLM-generated outputs
- Use prompt injection prevention techniques
- Implement rate limiting for API calls
