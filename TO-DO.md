# TO-DO - GNN Pipeline Roadmap

**Last Updated**: 2026-09-02 (MAJ-02/MAJ-03 closed 2026-08-24; v4.0.0 roadmap refreshed; 3.2.0 shipped)
**Current Version**: 3.2.0
**Next Target**: v4.0.0 (bounded autonomy, pipeline stage consolidation, multi-agent stigmergic topologies, and high-dimensional active inference)

**Recently closed** (audit trail in `CHANGELOG.md` and git history, not here):
MAJ-02 (sparse Kronecker factorized execution + scaling sweep + numbered-pipeline
integration) and MAJ-03 (native stigmergic multi-agent compilation with
env-conditioned action selection; probe:
`uv run pytest src/tests/render/test_stigmergic_multi_agent.py -q`). The 3.2.0
release receipt (tests, mypy, ruff, documentation audits) is in `CHANGELOG.md`
§3.2.0.

## Open Scoped Roadmap

No P1 roadmap item is currently open; forward-looking work is scoped under
v4.0.0 below.

## v4.0.0 - Bounded Autonomy & Reviewed Self-Editing

The local bounded-autonomy surface emits proposal-only artifacts via
`--autonomous`: candidate scores, review gates, rollback descriptors, audit
events, and non-mutating security policy. No source edit, commit, container
run, or cluster mutation is automatic.

## Verification Commands

Use `uv run` for roadmap verification checks:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python scripts/run_v3_orchestration_acceptance.py --strict
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python scripts/emit_run_manifest.py output --out /tmp/gnn-v3-run-manifest
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python scripts/generate_pipeline_container_plan.py --config input/config.yaml --out /tmp/gnn-v3-container-plan.json
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python scripts/run_session_acceptance.py --manifest input/model_family_manifest.json --output-dir /tmp/gnn-v3-session-acceptance --session /tmp/gnn-v3-session.json --strict
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python src/main.py --autonomous --target-dir input/gnn_files --output-dir /tmp/gnn-autonomous-smoke

uv run python doc/development/docs_audit.py --strict --check-anchors --no-write
uv run python scripts/check_gnn_doc_patterns.py --strict
uv run python scripts/check_maintained_doc_terms.py --strict
uv run python scripts/check_repo_terminology.py --strict
uv run python scripts/check_capability_contracts.py
uv run python scripts/run_semantic_fidelity_gate.py --output-dir /tmp/semantic_fidelity --strict
uv run python scripts/run_cross_framework_reliability.py --output-dir /tmp/cross_framework --strict
git diff --check
```

## Conventions

- Keep this file limited to unchecked, forward-looking work.
- Move shipped-version details to release notes, changelog entries, or durable
  verification artifacts.
- Keep closed work out of this file: completed items are removed when they
  land; the audit trail lives in `CHANGELOG.md` and git history.
- Scope open items with concrete tasks, file paths, verification commands, and
  acceptance criteria so the next session can execute without re-deriving them.


## GEO-INFER contract expansion

The delivered opt-in v1 format is specified in `src/export/geo_infer_contract.md`.
Further work must preserve independently installable runtimes and explicit matrix,
space and time semantics.

| ID | Scope | Acceptance evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GNN-04 | Pin paired repository revisions in cross-repository CI. | Independent locked environments complete both categorical and H3 round trips; receipts include source/artifact digests and both revisions. |
