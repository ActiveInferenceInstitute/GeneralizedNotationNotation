# GEO_INFER contract expansion verification

The paired change adds explicit Gaussian and factored interchange alongside the
strict categorical v1 export. Gaussian models declare discrete F/G/H/Q/R, units
and initial beliefs; factored JSON declares dependency axes and enumerated
policies. The repositories remain independently installable. See the
[Gaussian/categorical contract](../../src/gnn/export/geo_infer_contract.md) and
[factored contract](../../src/gnn/export/geo_infer_factored_contract.md).

Step 7 now consumes original source bytes and per-model physical metadata from
the API or CLI, retains nested identities, rejects output escapes and duplicate
metadata, and reports partial failures. Ordinary five-format defaults are kept.

## Ancestry and integration

The topic starts from local fleet commits `3f2694d3a` and `64d49355a`, based on
remote main `aa20514c77bb2cc4757be645755b3e3755ff8530`. Its PR therefore includes
the earlier module-quality sweep (deduplication, hardening, contract tests and
documentation), in addition to the GEO work. The original concurrently edited
checkout was preserved; integration uses an isolated topic worktree.

## Verification

- Full initial run: 4087 passed, 2 failed, 3 skipped, 2 warnings. The registry
  alias and optional-extra environment failures were reproduced and corrected.
- Targeted baseline corrections: 31 passed, including the numbered CLI, step
  registry, environment check and sync/async provider bridge. The bridge now
  detects a running event loop before allocating a coroutine and never retries
  provider RuntimeError as a loop error.
- Export/utils integration: 330 passed before final additional edge cases.
- Gaussian filtering: analytic unequal dimensions and overflow/axis rejection
  verified independently in GEO Python 3.11 and 3.12.
- Strict mypy and repository-wide Ruff checks run on the integrated tree.
- Paired CI runs in both directions: GEO_INFER pins a reviewed GNN commit, and
  this repository pins GEO_INFER in return (see the paired interchange section
  below). Hosted results belong to the PR checks; local success does not
  establish hosted success.

Fresh independent reviews reproduced and then verified fixes for double
conditioning, covariance-overflow validation, contradictory source axes, output
symlinks, duplicate metadata and factored numerical overflow. All completed
capabilities have explicit bounded semantics; Gaussian control selection and
large unbounded exact policy trees are not claimed.

## GNN-side paired interchange (GNN-04)

This repository now mirrors GEO_INFER's paired-revision mechanism on its side.
No fep_lean file, workflow or pin is involved; the mirror covers only the
GEO_INFER pair:

- [`.github/gnn-pair.json`](../../.github/gnn-pair.json) records the exact
  reviewed GEO_INFER revision. Read the committed pin for the current SHA;
  acceptance receipts name both checkouts and retain per-artifact digests.
  The historical expansion results above do not establish a new run. Note
  the deliberate name reuse: GEO_INFER's own `.github/gnn-pair.json` pins
  this repository, so each side names the other in a same-named file.
- `.github/workflows/geo-infer-interchange.yml` validates the pin (known
  slug, 40-hex revision), checks out GEO_INFER at exactly the pinned SHA into
  `geo-infer/`, syncs independent locked runtimes (matrix Python 3.11/3.12
  for the GEO environment; the GNN environment on 3.11 with the dev and
  geo-infer extras; the same heavy-package exclusions GEO's own CI uses), and
  runs `scripts/run_geo_interchange_checks.py`.
- `scripts/run_geo_interchange_checks.py` refuses a checkout that is not at
  the pinned revision, drives GEO's read-only
  `GEO-INFER-TEST/validate_gnn_interchange.py` — export inside the GNN
  environment, consume and deterministic replay inside the GEO environment,
  covering the categorical gridworld, the seven-cell H3 stay/diffuse model,
  the rectangular Gaussian and the explicit factored fixture — and writes a
  receipt directory: both revisions, the pin, the validator's full JSON
  trace, and `digest-manifest.json` cross-checking the per-artifact digests.
  Exit codes are faithful: 0 green, 1 round-trip or receipt failure, 2 pin or
  revision mismatch with nothing run.

What the hosted job proves: the pinned GEO checkout and this GNN checkout
still agree on the exchange contract at both matrix Pythons, with
deterministic replay certified and per-artifact digests retained. A red run
is the drift signal — one side moved since the pin was recorded — and the
pair must be re-pinned together in the same change set, never by suppressing
the check. What remains manual: local environment sync (the runner requires
an explicitly provided, already-synced GEO checkout and GNN interpreter), the
GEO_INFER side's own paired CI against its pin of this repository, and
hosted confirmation of this new workflow's own first runs. Local success —
including the local run recorded above — does not establish hosted success.

## Independent uv toolchains

GNN requires exact uv 0.13.4. The GEO companion has a named installation-only
exception, exact uv 0.13.1, required by its own `uv.toml`. Do not use one uv
version to install both repositories. The GNN paired workflow installs GEO
first with uv 0.13.1, then GNN with uv 0.13.4; its later GNN qualification
commands retain uv 0.13.4. Each setup action remains pinned independently.

For a local paired run, select both executable paths explicitly and use a real
GEO checkout of the revision in GNN's committed pair pin. Install the GEO
workspace with its uv 0.13.1 executable, locked dependencies, all packages and
extras, and the existing cupy, mayavi, vaex and vaex-core exclusions. Select
Python 3.11 and 3.12 in separate GEO environments to cover both hosted rows.
Install GNN with its uv 0.13.4 executable, locked dependencies, Python 3.11,
and the dev and geo-infer extras.

The [paired workflow](../../.github/workflows/geo-infer-interchange.yml) owns
the exact installation and runner command lines. Those options belong to uv
and the standalone interchange runner, rather than GNN's pipeline CLI.
Adapt the workflow's checkout paths to the local directories. Invoke
`scripts/run_geo_interchange_checks.py` with GNN's installed interpreter,
both checkout roots, both installed interpreter paths and a new receipt
directory. Its help describes those standalone arguments:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_geo_interchange_checks.py --help
```

After installation, invoke each environment's Python directly or select its
repository's required uv explicitly. The runner's revision and receipt checks
still apply; selecting the correct tools does not establish paired acceptance.
