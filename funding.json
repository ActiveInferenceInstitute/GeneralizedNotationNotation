        "description": "The Active Inference Institute is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit stewarding a long-horizon ecosystem around active inference and related fields. It coordinates open-source research projects, educational programs, and collaborative infrastructure that make active inference tools and concepts practically accessible to researchers, practitioners, and learners. Through community-maintained codebases, shared ontologies, and reproducible computational workflows, the Institute supports rigorous, interoperable, and application-ready active inference methods. Its activities span project incubation, technical stewardship, and public-facing resources that connect theory, simulation, and real-world use cases.",
