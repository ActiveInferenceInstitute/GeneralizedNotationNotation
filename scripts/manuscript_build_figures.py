"""Regenerate every manuscript figure deterministically.

Thin orchestrator that runs each ``scripts/manuscript_fig_*.py`` generator in turn,
so the manuscript's figures under ``output/figures/`` can be rebuilt from source with
a single command before rendering (the render pipeline does not regenerate figures).

It also writes ``output/figures/figure_registry.json``, the accessibility registry
the template's ``validate_figure_registry`` reads. The registry is *generated here*
rather than hand-authored precisely because it must not drift from the figures that
are actually built: the label, the produced filename and the generator that made it
all come from the same table below. Only ``alt_text`` is authored — it must describe
what a reader who cannot see the figure needs, in different words from the caption
(the caption is a title; the alt text says what the image shows).

Each entry also carries build provenance, which is what stops a stale figure from
shipping. ``png_sha256`` is the digest of the PNG this build produced, and
``consumed_tokens`` is the ``{key: value}`` map the generator actually read out of
``output/data/manuscript_variables.json`` (observed by
``scripts/lib/manuscript_figure_tokens.py``, not declared).
``src/tests/test_manuscript_figure_freshness.py`` re-checks both against the
committed PNG and the live token map, so a figure built before a count moved fails
the suite. Without it, ``fig:repo_metrics`` shipped "365 test files" on the same PDF
page as prose reading 367.

Usage:
    python scripts/manuscript_build_figures.py
The token map is regenerated unconditionally first (``z_generate``) and the
build fails unless its ``GNN_GIT_COMMIT`` equals this checkout's HEAD, so a
stale-but-present ``manuscript_variables.json`` can never be baked into fresh
PNGs. Exit code is non-zero if the regeneration or the commit check fails, any
generator fails, any expected PNG is missing, or the registry does not cover
every ``{#fig:...}`` label the manuscript declares.
