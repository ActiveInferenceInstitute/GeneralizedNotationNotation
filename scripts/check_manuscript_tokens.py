"""Manuscript integrity gate for GeneralizedNotationNotation.

Deterministic checks run before/after rendering the token-injected manuscript:

1. **Unknown tokens** — every ``{{TOKEN}}`` used in a rendered section must be a key
   emitted by ``gnn.manuscript.generate_variables``. An unknown token would
   survive substitution and render literally in the PDF.
2. **Dangling citations** — every Pandoc ``[@key]`` must resolve to an entry in
   ``manuscript/references.bib``.
3. **Hard-coded counts** — bare literals equal to a high-value producer count (e.g. the
   test-file count, MCP-tool count) are flagged: they should be ``{{TOKEN}}`` instead.
4. **Hard-coded step numbers** — a bare integer in a step phrase — "step 3",
   "Steps 5 and 6", and the plural forms where the number leads ("25 steps",
   "25-step pipeline") — that equals a ``GNN_STEP_*`` token value is flagged
   regardless of size. Step numbers are below the ``_HARDCODE_MIN`` floor the
   count scan uses, so they were invisible to check 3 while the producer
   emitted a token for every one of them.
5. **Malformed cross-references** — a pandoc-crossref marker glued to a stray prefix
   character (``+@fig:x``) still resolves, so no reference gate catches it, but the
   prefix renders literally into the PDF ("+fig. 2 depicts...").
6. **config.yaml drift** — ``manuscript/config.yaml`` is never token-substituted, so its
   ``version:`` / ``date:`` literals are compared against the producer's values.
7. **Figure accessibility registry** — every ``{#fig:...}`` label a section declares must
   have an ``output/figures/figure_registry.json`` entry with alt text and an existing
   image file. The template's own ``validate_figure_registry`` runs at the *validation*
   stage, not the render stage, so a render could (and did) ship a PDF with the registry
   absent entirely. This is the in-repo gate that does not depend on the template.
8. **Repository path claims** — every ``input/...`` literal must exist on disk, and where
   prose names a manifest family beside such a literal, the literal must match that
   family's declared ``target_dir``. Every other check compares a *number* against the
   producer; a path is not a number, so all of them stayed green while a commit moved a
   family's ``target_dir`` and three prose sites went on naming the old directory.
9. **Unresolved tokens in the shipped copy** — every ``{{TOKEN}}`` surviving in
   ``output/manuscript/**`` after hydration fails ``--strict``: that is a token
   the producer does not emit, rendered verbatim into the PDF.
10. **Cross-reference labels** — every ``@fig:...``/``@tbl:...`` reference must
   name a label a manuscript section declares (``{#fig:...}``/``{#tbl:...}``);
   a reference to a label that does not exist renders as "fig. ???".

Under ``--strict`` the gate additionally proves the committed artifacts agree
with the producer at HEAD:

* ``token_checksum(generate_variables(HEAD))`` must equal the checksum of the
  committed ``output/data/manuscript_variables.json``;
* every registry ``png_sha256`` must be the digest of the PNG on disk;
* every registry ``source_sha256`` digest must equal the file's bytes at HEAD
  on a clean tree (dirty trees compare against the working tree instead,
  since HEAD cannot describe uncommitted sources) — a figure built from
  working-tree data the prose does not describe (``fig:pipeline`` /
  ``fig:family_matrix`` / ``fig:backend_matrix`` read STEP_INDEX.md / the
  manifest / the registry directly) fails here.
undeclared cross-reference, config.yaml drift, contradicted path claim, or a
``GNN_GIT_COMMIT`` of ``unknown`` is found (hard gate). Hard-coded count and
step-number findings and the strict artifact-agreement checks are reported as
warnings unless ``--strict`` is passed.
