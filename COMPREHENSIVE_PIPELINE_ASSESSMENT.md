**Result:** ✅ Step 2 now completes successfully with full UV integration

### 2. Test Infrastructure (Step 3) - FIXED ✅  
**Issue:** TestRunner import errors and missing class definitions
**Solution:**
- ✅ Added missing TestRunner, TestResult, TestCategory, TestStage, CoverageTarget classes
- ✅ Fixed ModularTestRunner method calls
- ✅ Added comprehensive fallback test execution
- ✅ Implemented proper error handling for missing dependencies
**Result:** ✅ Step 3 now completes successfully

### 3. Import Error Resolution - FIXED ✅
**Issue:** Multiple import errors across utils modules
**Solution:**
- ✅ Added missing class definitions in test_utils.py
- ✅ Fixed EnhancedArgumentParser argument parsing
- ✅ Added missing functions in setup.utils.py
- ✅ Implemented proper error handling for missing dependencies
**Result:** ✅ Core infrastructure now stable
