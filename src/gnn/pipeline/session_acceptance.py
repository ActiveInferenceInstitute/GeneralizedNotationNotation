"""Resumable, session-wrapped model-family acceptance orchestration.

Wraps the existing manifest-driven model-family acceptance runner
(:mod:`pipeline.model_family_acceptance`) in a resumable :class:`RunSession`
(:mod:`pipeline.run_session`) so an extended multi-family acceptance run is
checkpointed after every family and can be resumed after a crash.

This module is pure orchestration over the existing acceptance runner. It
NEVER executes the pipeline, runs containers, or calls clusters: it delegates
to ``run_model_family_acceptance`` (which itself only stages on-disk fixtures
and invokes an injectable ``runner`` callable), records per-family ledgers and
artifact directories, and checkpoints a session manifest to disk after each
family so an interrupted run is resumable.

The session work units are the family names. Each family is processed in its
own single-family acceptance run; the unit is marked ``DONE`` on a passing
ledger and ``FAILED`` on an exception or a failed ledger. Checkpoint writes are
atomic (handled by :func:`pipeline.run_session.checkpoint`).

verify_session_artifacts joins a session checkpoint's recorded per-unit
artifact inventories against the on-disk artifacts (Perf#6): recorded files
must exist with matching digests and the directory inventory must be complete.
