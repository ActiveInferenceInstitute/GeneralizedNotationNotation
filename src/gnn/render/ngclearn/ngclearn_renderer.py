"""
ngc-learn Renderer for GNN Specifications

Renders continuous (linear-Gaussian) GNN models to standalone ngc-learn
simulation scripts. Codegen-only (pytorch precedent): the renderer never
imports ``ngclearn`` — the generated script does, behind an import-or-exit
guard. Discrete POMDPs have no ngc-learn representation and are reported
first-class unsupported.
