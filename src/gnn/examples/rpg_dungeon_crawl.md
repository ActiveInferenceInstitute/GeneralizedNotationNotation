## ModelName
Collaborative Role Playing Game with Active Inference Agents

## ModelAnnotation
This model represents a comprehensive Role Playing Game scenario with:
- Multiple player characters (Fighter, Mage, Rogue, Cleric) each with distinct capabilities and goals
- Dungeon Master as an adaptive environmental controller and narrative agent
- Dynamic labyrinth environment with rooms, corridors, traps, monsters, and treasures
- Multi-modal observations (visual, auditory, tactical, social, magical)
- Complex action spaces (movement, combat, magic, social interaction, exploration)
- Collaborative decision-making with turn-based coordination
- Uncertainty from dice mechanics and hidden information
- Hierarchical goal structures (immediate survival, quest objectives, character development)
- Emergent narrative through agent interactions and environmental responses

The model enables rich collaborative gameplay with adaptive AI agents that can:
- Plan coordinated strategies while maintaining individual character motivations
- Adapt to unexpected environmental changes and DM narrative decisions
- Learn from experience and develop character-specific expertise
- Balance competition and cooperation in dynamic social situations
- Generate emergent storytelling through believable character interactions

# Character state inference:
# q(s_character) = Ïƒ(ln(P(o|s)) + ln(P(s|s_prev,a)) + EFE_character)

# Collaborative policy inference:
# q(Ï€_joint) = Ïƒ(-G_collaborative - Î£_i(G_individual_i))

# Party coordination dynamics:
# coordination_t+1 = coordination_t + Î±(successful_actions) - Î²(conflicting_actions)

# Character development:
# experience_t+1 = experience_t + reward(actions, outcomes)

# DM adaptive difficulty:
# difficulty_scaling_t+1 = difficulty_scaling_t + Îµ(party_performance - target_challenge)

# Expected Free Energy for coordination:
# G_collaborative = Î£_t[KL(q(s_joint|Ï€)||p(s_joint)) + KL(q(o_joint|Ï€)||p(o_joint|C_joint))]
