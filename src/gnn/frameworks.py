"""Canonical framework enumeration for the GNN pipeline.

One tuple, one source: every framework list that enumerates the pipeline's
backends derives from ``ALL_FRAMEWORKS`` here, so a backend added or removed
in one place is added or removed everywhere. The rich per-framework render
configuration stays in ``gnn.render.framework_registry.FRAMEWORK_REGISTRY``
(the canonical render inventory); this module owns only the name
enumeration. Self-consistency between the two is enforced by
``tests/render/test_framework_availability.py``.

Capability-scoped subsets (executor registry-runners, planning language
classification, analyzer-backed frameworks, the profiled
``MAINTAINED_FRAMEWORKS`` trio in ``pipeline.cross_framework_reliability``)
are intentional subsets, not alternate enumerations, and keep their own
definitions with a comment naming the capability they encode.
