GNN Processing Pipeline - Step 2: Setup

This script performs initial setup tasks:
- Verifies and creates necessary output directories.
- Sets up the Python virtual environment and installs dependencies.

Usage:
    python 2_setup.py [options]
    (Typically called by main.py)
    
Options:
    Same as main.py (passes arguments through)
