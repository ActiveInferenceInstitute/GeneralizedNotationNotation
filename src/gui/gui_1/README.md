# GUI 1: Form-based Interactive GNN Constructor

## Overview
This module provides the primary form-based GUI functionality for the Generalized Notation Notation (GNN) pipeline. Operating as a component of **Step 22**, it provides a real-time, interactive environment to scaffold, edit, and orchestrate generative model parameters directly from the browser.

## Key Features
- **Form-Based Component Management**: Interactive Gradio forms to dynamically add, update, and remove model components such as matrices (A, B, C, D) and vectors.
- **State Space Editing**: Live validation and manipulation of hierarchical state spaces and modalities.
- **Live Markdown Synchronization**: A split-pane layout giving real-time visualization of changes mapping directly into the standard GNN `.md` underlying storage format.
- **Headless Mode Capable**: Easily triggerable in headless pipelines for automated text-layer synchronization.

## Quick Start
You can launch this GUI directly via the pipeline's GUI orchestrator:
```bash
# General invocation
python src/22_gui.py --gui-types gui_1 --target-dir input/gnn_files/ --output-dir output/22_gui_output/

# Headless setup
python src/22_gui.py --gui-types gui_1 --headless
```

## Internal Architecture
- **`__init__.py`**: Public module registry pointing to execution entry points.
- **`ui.py`**: Gradio interface layouts and event endpoint bindings.
- **`processor.py`**: Intermediary logic connecting interface behaviors to core GNN parsing structures.
- **`markdown.py`**: AST-like string synchronization logic ensuring robust read/writing without corrupting manual edits.
- **`mcp.py`**: Model Context Protocol registration (for AI agents using remote operations).
