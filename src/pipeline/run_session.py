"""Resumable run-session management for long-running pipeline acceptance runs.

Pure data layer for orchestrating extended model-family acceptance runs across
many work units. Provides resumable run manifests, status inspection, and
cancellation-safe cleanup. This module NEVER executes containers, calls
docker/kubectl, opens sockets, or mutates any live infrastructure — it only
generates, validates, serializes, replays, and cleans up its own local manifest
and artifact files under an explicitly provided working directory.

All checkpoint writes are atomic (write to a temp file in the same directory,
then ``os.replace``) so an interrupted write never corrupts an existing
manifest. No wall-clock values participate in the run hash.
