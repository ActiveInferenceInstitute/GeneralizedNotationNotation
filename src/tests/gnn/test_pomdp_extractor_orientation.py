"""B-matrix orientation contract: provenance detection, contradiction, canonicalization.

Contract under test (pinned decisions #1, #11, #12):
- matrix_provenance["B"] gains declared_order / detected_order / canonical_order /
  contradiction (contradiction only on positive evidence, never on
  doubly-stochastic ambiguity).
- strict_validation=True surfaces a contradiction as a structured error;
  stored B_matrix is NEVER transposed at extraction time.
- canonicalize_pomdp(spec) returns a NEW spec with B in
  (next_state, previous_state, action) order and leaves the input untouched.

Fixture strategy: the committed actinf exemplar is comment-consistent (impl-
bcanonical fixed it), so tests inject their own contradictory B comments into
a tmp_path copy rather than depending on the exemplar's phrasing.
