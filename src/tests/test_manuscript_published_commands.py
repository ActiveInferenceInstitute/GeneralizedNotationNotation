"""Every command the manuscript prints must be one the repository accepts.

§6 opens by promising it "lists only commands that exist in the repository, so
that a reader with a clean checkout can reproduce the pipeline". It shipped

    uv run python scripts/run_model_family_acceptance.py \\
      --manifest input/model_family_manifest.json --strict

which exits 2 on a clean checkout: ``--output-dir`` is ``required=True``. The
file existed, so no gate noticed; "exists" was being read as "the path is
there", not "the invocation runs".

These tests read the published command back out of the manuscript and check it
against the script's own ``argparse`` declarations: every flag it passes must be
declared, and every declared ``required=True`` option must be passed. That is a
static check — it does not prove the command succeeds, only that the repository
would accept its arguments — but it is exactly the class of defect that
shipped, and unlike running the gates it costs nothing and cannot go stale.

Scope: commands invoking ``scripts/*.py`` (directly or as ``-m scripts.<name>``),
whose arguments are declared by a single ``argparse`` parser in that file. Any
other printed ``.py`` path is still checked to exist in this repository — except
the one command §6.3 states explicitly runs from the docxology template's
checkout, which is exempted by name below and whose exemption is itself pinned
to that prose claim.
