## ModelName

Hybrid Discrete-Continuous POMDP

## ModelAnnotation

This model describes a minimal hybrid agent: a 2-state discrete POMDP
declared in the SAME parameterization as a passive 2-dim continuous
linear-Gaussian (LGSSM) block:

- 2 hidden states: "left" and "right" in a symmetric bistable potential.
- 2 noisy observations: the agent gets a noisy readout of which side it is on.
- 1 action: a single push that perturbs the discrete transition.
- A continuous block (F/H/Q/R with a Gaussian prior) is declared alongside
  the discrete A/B/C/D matrices; the continuous state evolves passively and
  shares no variables with the discrete POMDP.

Hybrid specs classify under BOTH families — `detect_model_kinds` returns
{HYBRID, CONTINUOUS} — and no framework renders the mix whole: the render
step reports every framework as `unsupported-composition` (continuous x
hybrid) rather than silently rendering the spec as discrete-only or
continuous-only. Per-framework hybrid rendering is future work on the
renderer side.

## InitialParameterization

# A: 2x2 with noise — 80% accurate observation

A={
  (0.8, 0.2),
  (0.2, 0.8)
}

# B: 1 action. The transition tensor B is stored as (next_state, previous_state, action); per-action slices are column-stochastic: rows are next states, columns are previous states, and each column sums to 1 over next states.

B={
  ( (0.8, 0.3), (0.2, 0.7) )
}

# C: Prefer observation 1 (right)

C={(0.0, 2.0)}

# D: Start uncertain

D={(0.5, 0.5)}

# F: Euler discretization (dt = 0.1) of dx/dt = F x with mild velocity damping.

F={
  (1.0, 0.1),
  (0.0, 0.9)
}

# H: two noisy position readouts (both observation channels read position).

H={
  (1.0, 0.0),
  (1.0, 0.0)
}

# Q: process-noise covariance = gamma_state^-1 * I (gamma_state = 10.0).

Q={
  (0.1, 0.0),
  (0.0, 0.1)
}

# R: observation-noise covariance = gamma_obs^-1 * I (gamma_obs = 5.0).

R={
  (0.2, 0.0),
  (0.0, 0.2)
}

# Gaussian prior over the initial continuous state: position fairly certain,
# velocity less so.

## Equations

# Discrete POMDP updates

# qs = infer_states(observation) — Bayesian belief update

# G(pi) = EFE(pi) — Expected Free Energy per policy

# u ~ softmax(-G) — Action selection

# Continuous linear-Gaussian block (passive, independent of the POMDP):

#   x_1 ~ N(prior_mean, prior_cov)

#   x_t = F x_{t-1} + N(0, Q)      (passive: no control input)

#   y_t = H x_t + N(0, R)

Hybrid Discrete-Continuous POMDP v1 - a composed hybrid x continuous GNN
model: the minimal 2-state POMDP is declared alongside a passive 2-dim
linear-Gaussian block. detect_model_kinds classifies it {HYBRID,
CONTINUOUS}; every framework receipts it unsupported-composition
(continuous x hybrid) instead of silently rendering one family.
