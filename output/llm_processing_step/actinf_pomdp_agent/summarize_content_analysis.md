# Summary of Classic Active Inference POMDP Agent GNN Specification

## Model Overview
The Classic Active Inference POMDP Agent is a discrete Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) model designed for a single modality and single factor of hidden states. It operates by inferring hidden states based on observations and selecting actions to minimize expected free energy, facilitating decision-making in uncertain environments.

## Key Variables
- **Hidden States**:
  - `location`: Represents the agent's position, with three possible states (0, 1, 2).
  
- **Observations**:
  - `state_observation`: The outcomes of the agent's observations, with three possible outcomes (0, 1, 2), where each observation corresponds to a specific hidden state.

- **Actions/Controls**:
  - `u`: The action taken by the agent, selected from three discrete actions that control the transition between hidden states.
  - `Ï€`: The policy vector representing the distribution over possible actions, guiding the agent's decision-making process.

## Critical Parameters
- **Matrices**:
  - **A (Likelihood Matrix)**: A[3,3] that maps hidden states to observations, indicating that each hidden state deterministically produces a unique observation.
  - **B (Transition Matrix)**: B[3,3,3] that defines state transitions based on previous states and actions, where each action deterministically leads to a new state.
  - **C (Log Preference Vector)**: C[3] that encodes the agent's preferences over observations, with a preference for observing state 2.
  - **D (Prior Vector)**: D[3] representing a uniform prior distribution over the initial hidden states.

- **Key Hyperparameters**:
  - `num_hidden_states`: 3 (indicating three possible hidden states).
  - `num_obs`: 3 (indicating three possible observations).
  - `num_actions`: 3 (indicating three possible actions).

## Notable Features
- The model is designed for a discrete time framework with an unbounded time horizon, allowing for continuous operation without a predefined endpoint.
- The initial policy prior (habit) is uniform, indicating no initial preference for any action, which can be useful for exploratory behavior in uncertain environments.
- The model's structure is explicitly parameterized, facilitating easy translation into code or simulation frameworks for Active Inference.

## Use Cases
This model can be applied in scenarios where an agent must make decisions based on incomplete information about its environment, such as robotics, autonomous navigation, and interactive AI systems that require adaptive behavior in dynamic settings. It is particularly useful for tasks involving exploration and exploitation in uncertain environments, where the agent needs to infer hidden states and optimize its actions accordingly.
