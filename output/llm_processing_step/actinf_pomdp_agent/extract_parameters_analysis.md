Here is a systematic breakdown of the parameters extracted from the provided GNN specification for the Classic Active Inference POMDP Agent:

### 1. Model Matrices

#### A Matrices (Likelihood Matrix)
- **Dimensions**: \(3 \times 3\)
- **Structure**: 
  - Each row corresponds to an observation outcome.
  - Each column corresponds to a hidden state.
- **Interpretation**: 
  - The likelihood matrix \(A\) defines the probability of observing a specific outcome given the hidden state. In this case, each hidden state deterministically maps to a unique observation outcome.

#### B Matrices (Transition Matrix)
- **Dimensions**: \(3 \times 3 \times 3\)
- **Structure**: 
  - The first dimension corresponds to the next hidden state.
  - The second dimension corresponds to the previous hidden states.
  - The third dimension corresponds to the actions taken.
- **Interpretation**: 
  - The transition matrix \(B\) specifies the probabilities of transitioning to a new hidden state based on the previous state and the action taken. Each action deterministically leads to a specific next state.

#### C Matrices (Log Preference Vector)
- **Dimensions**: \(3\)
- **Structure**: 
  - A vector of log-probabilities over the observation outcomes.
- **Interpretation**: 
  - The log preference vector \(C\) encodes the agent's preferences for different observations. In this case, the agent has a preference for observing the third state.

#### D Matrices (Prior Vector)
- **Dimensions**: \(3\)
- **Structure**: 
  - A vector representing the prior beliefs over the hidden states.
- **Interpretation**: 
  - The prior vector \(D\) indicates uniform prior beliefs across the three hidden states, suggesting no initial bias towards any state.

### 2. Precision Parameters
- **γ (Gamma)**: 
  - Not explicitly defined in the GNN specification, but typically represents the precision of beliefs or confidence in the model parameters.
  
- **α (Alpha)**: 
  - Not explicitly defined in the GNN specification, but generally refers to learning rates or adaptation parameters that influence how quickly the agent updates its beliefs based on new observations.

- **Other Precision/Confidence Parameters**: 
  - Not specified in the document, but could include parameters that control the noise in observations or the uncertainty in state transitions.

### 3. Dimensional Parameters
- **State Space Dimensions**: 
  - Number of hidden states: \(3\) (as indicated by \(s[3,1]\)).
  
- **Observation Space Dimensions**: 
  - Number of observations: \(3\) (as indicated by \(o[3,1]\)).
  
- **Action Space Dimensions**: 
  - Number of actions: \(3\) (as indicated by \(B\) and \(π[3]\)).

### 4. Temporal Parameters
- **Time Horizons (T)**: 
  - Defined as unbounded, indicating that the agent can operate indefinitely without a fixed endpoint.
  
- **Temporal Dependencies and Windows**: 
  - Not explicitly defined, but the model operates in discrete time steps as indicated by \(t[1]\).

- **Update Frequencies and Timescales**: 
  - Not specified, but typically, updates occur at each time step based on new observations.

### 5. Initial Conditions
- **Prior Beliefs Over Initial States**: 
  - Uniform prior over hidden states defined in vector \(D\) as \((0.33333, 0.33333, 0.33333)\).

- **Initial Parameter Values**: 
  - Defined explicitly in the \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(E\) matrices.

- **Initialization Strategies**: 
  - Not explicitly mentioned, but the uniform priors suggest a non-informative initialization strategy.

### 6. Configuration Summary
- **Parameter File Format Recommendations**: 
  - The GNN specification is already structured in a machine-readable format, suitable for translation into code or simulation.

- **Tunable vs. Fixed Parameters**: 
  - Tunable parameters include the entries in matrices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(E\), while the dimensions and structure of the matrices are fixed.

- **Sensitivity Analysis Priorities**: 
  - Important parameters for sensitivity analysis would include the likelihood matrix \(A\), transition matrix \(B\), and preference vector \(C\), as they directly influence the agent's behavior and performance in the POMDP framework.

This breakdown provides a comprehensive overview of the parameters and their implications in the context of Active Inference and POMDPs, facilitating a deeper understanding of the model's structure and functionality.
