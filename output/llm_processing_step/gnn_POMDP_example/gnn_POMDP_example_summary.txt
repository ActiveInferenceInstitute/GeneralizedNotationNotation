### Summary of GNN Model: Standard POMDP Agent v1.0

**Model Purpose:**  
The model represents a comprehensive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) agent designed for testing GNN parsing and rendering capabilities, particularly within the PyMDP framework.

**Key Components:**

1. **Model Name:**
   - Standard POMDP Agent v1.0

2. **Primary States:**
   - **Hidden State Factors:**
     - **Location:** 3 states (e.g., RoomA, RoomB, Corridor)
     - **ResourceLevel:** 2 states (e.g., Low, High)

3. **Observations:**
   - **Observation Modalities:**
     - **VisualCue:** 4 outcomes (e.g., Door, Window, Food, Empty)
     - **AuditorySignal:** 2 outcomes (e.g., Silence, Beep)

4. **Control Factors:**
   - **Actions:**
     - **Movement:** 3 actions (e.g., Stay, MoveClockwise, MoveCounterClockwise)
     - **Interaction:** 2 actions (e.g., Wait, InteractWithResource)

**Main Connections:**
- **Priors to Initial States:** The model establishes connections between prior distributions over hidden states and the hidden states themselves.
- **States to Likelihoods:** The hidden states influence the likelihoods of observations, connecting states to observations.
- **States and Actions to Transitions:** The model captures how current states and chosen actions determine the transitions to next states.
- **Preferences to Expected Free Energy:** Preferences for observations are linked to the calculation of Expected Free Energy (EFE), which evaluates the policies.
- **Policies to Actions:** The calculated policies inform the chosen actions for the agent.

This GNN model serves as a structured framework for simulating decision-making processes under uncertainty, integrating hidden states, observations, actions, and their respective interactions.
