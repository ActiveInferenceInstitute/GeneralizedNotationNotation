### Summary of the GNN Model: Comprehensive POMDP Agent

**Model Name:** Standard POMDP Agent v1.0

**Purpose:** 
This model represents a comprehensive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) agent. It is designed to evaluate GNN parsing and rendering capabilities, particularly for applications like PyMDP.

**Key Components:**

1. **Hidden State Factors:**
   - **Location (s_f0):** 3 states (e.g., RoomA, RoomB, Corridor).
   - **Resource Level (s_f1):** 2 states (e.g., Low, High).

2. **Observation Modalities:**
   - **Visual Cue (o_m0):** 4 outcomes (e.g., Door, Window, Food, Empty).
   - **Auditory Signal (o_m1):** 2 outcomes (e.g., Silence, Beep).

3. **Control Factors (Actions):**
   - **Movement (pi_c0):** 3 actions (e.g., Stay, MoveClockwise, MoveCounterClockwise).
   - **Interaction (pi_c1):** 2 actions (e.g., Wait, InteractWithResource).

4. **Likelihood Mapping:**
   - **A_m0:** Likelihood of visual cues based on location and resource level.
   - **A_m1:** Likelihood of auditory signals based on the same factors.

5. **Transition Dynamics:**
   - **B_f0:** Transition dynamics for location influenced by current state and actions.
   - **B_f1:** Transition dynamics for resource level similarly influenced.

6. **Preferences:**
   - **C_m0:** Log preferences for visual cues.
   - **C_m1:** Log preferences for auditory signals.

7. **Initial Priors:**
   - **D_f0:** Priors for initial location states.
   - **D_f1:** Priors for initial resource level states.

**Main Connections:**
- Initial priors (D_f0, D_f1) connect to hidden states (s_f0, s_f1).
- Hidden states influence the likelihoods (A_m0, A_m1), which in turn affect observations (o_m0, o_m1).
- States and actions feed into the transition dynamics (B_f0, B_f1), determining next states.
- Preferences and states/observations are linked to the Expected Free Energy (G), which then informs policy decisions (pi_c0, pi_c1) and chosen actions (u_c0, u_c1).

Overall, the model encapsulates the complexities of a POMDP agent, emphasizing the interplay between hidden states, observations, actions, and decision-making processes within a structured GNN framework.
