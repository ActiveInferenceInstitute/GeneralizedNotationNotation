### Summary of the GNN Model: Comprehensive POMDP Agent

**Model Name:** Standard POMDP Agent v1.0

**Purpose:**
This model represents a comprehensive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) agent designed for testing GNN features, particularly for PyMDP. It emphasizes state estimation, policy evaluation, and action selection in a dynamic environment.

**Key Components:**
1. **Hidden States:**
   - **Location (3 states):** Represents different locations such as RoomA, RoomB, and Corridor.
   - **ResourceLevel (2 states):** Describes the availability of resources, categorized as Low or High.

2. **Observations:**
   - **VisualCue (4 outcomes):** Possible outcomes include Door, Window, Food, and Empty.
   - **AuditorySignal (2 outcomes):** Includes Silence and Beep.

3. **Control Factors (Actions):**
   - **Movement (3 actions):** Actions include Stay, MoveClockwise, and MoveCounterClockwise.
   - **Interaction (2 actions):** Actions consist of Wait and InteractWithResource.

4. **Policies:**
   - Two policy vectors (pi_c0 for Movement and pi_c1 for Interaction) that govern the agent's actions based on the current state.

5. **Likelihood Mappings and Transition Dynamics:**
   - **Likelihoods (A_m0 and A_m1):** Define the probability of observing certain cues given the hidden states.
   - **Transition Dynamics (B_f0 and B_f1):** Model the state transitions based on previous states and actions taken.

6. **Preferences:**
   - Preferences (C_m0 and C_m1) indicate the agentâ€™s biases towards certain observations, guiding the decision-making process.

7. **Initial States:**
   - Priors over initial hidden states (D_f0 for Location and D_f1 for ResourceLevel) provide starting conditions for the model.

**Main Connections:**
- Priors lead to initial hidden states.
- Hidden states influence the likelihood of observations.
- States and actions dictate transitions to next states.
- Preferences and observations contribute to the calculation of Expected Free Energy (EFE).
- EFE then informs the policy decisions, which culminate in the selection of actions.

This model is structured to enable simulations and evaluations of POMDP strategies, providing a framework for understanding decision-making in uncertain environments.
