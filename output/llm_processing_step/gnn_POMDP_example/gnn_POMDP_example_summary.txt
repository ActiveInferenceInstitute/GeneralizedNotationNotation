The GNN model outlined in the document is a **Standard POMDP Agent v1.0**, designed as a comprehensive example for testing GNN features, particularly with the PyMDP framework. It represents a **Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)** agent that integrates several key components:

### Key Components:
1. **Hidden States**:
   - **Location**: 3 states (e.g., RoomA, RoomB, Corridor).
   - **ResourceLevel**: 2 states (e.g., Low, High).

2. **Observations**:
   - **VisualCue**: 4 outcomes (e.g., Door, Window, Food, Empty).
   - **AuditorySignal**: 2 outcomes (e.g., Silence, Beep).

3. **Control Factors**:
   - **Movement**: 3 actions (e.g., Stay, MoveClockwise, MoveCounterClockwise).
   - **Interaction**: 2 actions (e.g., Wait, InteractWithResource).

### Main Connections:
- **Priors to Initial States**: Initial distributions over the hidden states (Location and ResourceLevel) are established from priors.
- **States to Observations**: Hidden states influence the likelihood of observations through likelihood mappings.
- **States and Actions to Transitions**: The current hidden states and chosen actions determine the transitions to the next states.
- **Preferences and Observations to Expected Free Energy (EFE)**: The preferences for observations impact the calculation of the EFE, which guides policy decisions.
- **Policies to Chosen Actions**: The EFE is used to derive the chosen actions for both movement and interaction.

The model is intended to facilitate understanding and testing of POMDPs and their applications in active inference, with a focus on the interactions between hidden states, observations, actions, and policies. Overall, it serves as a foundational example for exploring the capabilities of GNN frameworks in modeling decision processes under uncertainty.
