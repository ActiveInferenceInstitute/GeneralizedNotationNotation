### Summary of the GNN Model: Comprehensive POMDP Agent

**Model Name:**  
Standard POMDP Agent v1.0

**Purpose:**  
This model represents a comprehensive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) agent designed to test various GNN parsing and rendering capabilities, particularly within the context of active inference and decision-making processes.

**Key Components:**

1. **Hidden States (2 Factors):**
   - **Location (3 States):** Represents different locations (e.g., RoomA, RoomB, Corridor).
   - **Resource Level (2 States):** Indicates the availability of resources (e.g., Low, High).

2. **Observations (2 Modalities):**
   - **Visual Cue (4 Outcomes):** Various visual inputs (e.g., Door, Window, Food, Empty).
   - **Auditory Signal (2 Outcomes):** Sound inputs (e.g., Silence, Beep).

3. **Control Factors (2 Actions):**
   - **Movement (3 Actions):** Options for movement (e.g., Stay, MoveClockwise, MoveCounterClockwise).
   - **Interaction (2 Actions):** Actions related to interacting with resources (e.g., Wait, InteractWithResource).

4. **Expected Free Energy (EFE):**  
   - Overall evaluation of combined policies, accounting for preferences and states, which informs action selection.

**Main Connections:**
- **Priors to Initial States:** The model starts with specified priors for hidden states, linking them to their respective hidden state factors.
- **States to Likelihoods:** The hidden states influence the likelihoods of observations, where the observations are derived from the state factors.
- **States and Actions to Transitions:** The current states and chosen actions determine the transitions to the next states, encapsulated in transition matrices for both location and resource levels.
- **Preferences to EFE:** Preferences for observations contribute to the calculation of expected free energy, guiding the agent's decision-making process.
- **Policies to Actions:** The selected policies directly determine the actions taken by the agent.

This model serves as a foundational example for developing and testing POMDP frameworks within GNN applications, emphasizing the integration of state estimation, action selection, and preference modeling.
