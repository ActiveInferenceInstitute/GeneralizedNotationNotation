### Summary of the GNN Model: Comprehensive POMDP Agent

**Model Name:** Standard POMDP Agent v1.0

**Purpose:**  
The model represents a comprehensive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) agent designed to facilitate testing and demonstration of GNN features, particularly for PyMDP. It includes various factors for hidden states, observations, actions, and policies to simulate decision-making under uncertainty.

**Key Components:**

1. **Hidden States:**
   - **Location (3 states):** Represents different locations such as RoomA, RoomB, and Corridor.
   - **Resource Level (2 states):** Indicates the availability of resources, categorized as Low or High.

2. **Observations:**
   - **Visual Cues (4 outcomes):** Possible observations include Door, Window, Food, and Empty.
   - **Auditory Signals (2 outcomes):** Possible observations include Silence and Beep.

3. **Control Factors (Actions):**
   - **Movement (3 actions):** Actions include Stay, MoveClockwise, and MoveCounterClockwise.
   - **Interaction (2 actions):** Actions include Wait and InteractWithResource.

4. **Policies:**
   - The model includes policy distributions over actions for movement and interaction, which influence the agent's decisions based on its state and observations.

**Main Connections:**
- **Initial State Priors:** The model connects initial state priors to the hidden states, indicating a starting point for the agent's beliefs about its environment.
- **States to Observations:** Hidden states influence observations through likelihood mappings, establishing how different states affect what the agent perceives.
- **States and Actions to Transitions:** The model defines how current states and chosen actions lead to transitions to next states, capturing the dynamics of the environment.
- **Preferences to Expected Free Energy:** Log preferences over outcomes feed into the calculation of Expected Free Energy (EFE), guiding the agent's decision-making process.
- **Policies to Actions:** Policies inform the chosen actions, connecting the theoretical framework to practical implementations in the agent's behavior.

This model serves as a foundational example for exploring complex decision-making scenarios in uncertain environments, utilizing the GNN framework to structure its components and interactions effectively.
