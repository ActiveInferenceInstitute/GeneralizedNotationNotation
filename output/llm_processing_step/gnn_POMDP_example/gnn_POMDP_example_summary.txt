### Summary of the GNN Model: Comprehensive POMDP Agent

**Model Name:**  
Standard POMDP Agent v1.0

**Purpose:**  
This model represents a comprehensive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) agent designed for testing GNN parsing and rendering capabilities, particularly in the context of PyMDP.

**Key Components:**

1. **Hidden States:**
   - **Location (3 states):** Represents possible locations such as RoomA, RoomB, and Corridor.
   - **Resource Level (2 states):** Indicates resource availability, categorized as Low or High.

2. **Observations:**
   - **Visual Cue (4 outcomes):** Includes Door, Window, Food, and Empty.
   - **Auditory Signal (2 outcomes):** Consists of Silence and Beep.

3. **Control Factors (Actions):**
   - **Movement (3 actions):** Actions include Stay, MoveClockwise, and MoveCounterClockwise.
   - **Interaction (2 actions):** Actions encompass Wait and InteractWithResource.

**Main Connections:**

- **Priors to Initial States:** Initial state priors (D_f0 for Location and D_f1 for Resource Level) influence the hidden state factors (s_f0 and s_f1).
  
- **States to Observations:** The hidden states (s_f0 and s_f1) are connected to likelihoods (A_m0 and A_m1) which lead to the observed modalities (o_m0 and o_m1).

- **States and Actions to Transitions:** The transitions (B_f0 and B_f1) depend on current hidden states and chosen actions, determining the next state (s_f0_next and s_f1_next).

- **Preferences and Outcomes to Expected Free Energy (EFE):** Preferences (C_m0 and C_m1) and states/observations contribute to the calculation of expected free energy (G).

- **EFE to Policies:** The expected free energy (G) influences the control policies (pi_c0 and pi_c1), which in turn determine the chosen actions (u_c0 and u_c1).

This model is structured to evaluate the dynamics of a POMDP agent, focusing on the interplay between hidden states, observations, and actions to optimize decision-making under uncertainty.
