### 1. Summary
The **Gold Standard POMDP Agent v1.0** is a comprehensive model designed to represent a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) agent. It is structured to test the capabilities of the Generalized Notation Notation (GNN) pipeline and contains the following key components:
- **Hidden States:** Two factors representing **Location** (3 states) and **ResourceLevel** (2 states).
- **Observation Modalities:** Two modalities including **VisualCue** (4 outcomes) and **AuditorySignal** (2 outcomes).
- **Control Factors:** Two types of actions: **Movement** (3 actions) and **Interaction** (2 actions).
The model emphasizes the interaction of state estimation, action selection, and observation likelihoods in a dynamic environment.

### 2. General Explanation
The primary purpose of this GNN model is to simulate an agent's decision-making process in environments where it has incomplete information about its state. It captures the complexity of real-world scenarios where an agent must infer hidden states (like its location and resource levels) based on observations (like visual cues and auditory signals) while taking actions that influence future states.

The state space is defined by two hidden state factors: **Location** and **ResourceLevel**, which together represent the agent's internal state. The model employs various observation modalities to gather data about the environment, allowing the agent to make informed decisions. The interactions between these components are governed by transition dynamics (how states evolve based on actions) and likelihood mappings (how observations relate to states). This setup facilitates the evaluation of policies through Expected Free Energy (EFE), guiding the agent's action choices based on inferred states and preferences.

### 4. Connectivity Description
The connections outlined in the model establish a structured flow of information between the various components:

- **Initial Priors to Hidden States**: The parameters D_f0 and D_f1 (initial priors for Location and ResourceLevel) feed into the hidden states s_f0 and s_f1, indicating the starting beliefs about the agent's state.

- **State to Likelihoods to Observations**: The hidden states (s_f0 and s_f1) influence the likelihood mappings (A_m0 and A_m1), which determine how probable certain observations are given the current states. This relationship allows the agent to update its beliefs based on observed data.

- **States and Actions to Transitions**: The hidden states and chosen actions (u_c0 and u_c1) feed into the transition dynamics (B_f0 and B_f1), which dictate how the agent's states evolve over time based on its actions. This highlights the importance of actions in shaping the future state of the agent.

- **Preferences and States/Observations to EFE**: The preferences (C_m0 and C_m1) for observations are connected to the calculation of Expected Free Energy (G), which represents the desirability of different policies based on current state beliefs.

- **Policies to Chosen Actions**: Finally, the policies (pi_c0 and pi_c1) are derived from the EFE, leading to the selection of actions (u_c0 and u_c1), thus completing the loop of decision-making where actions are influenced by policies shaped by state beliefs and observation preferences.

Overall, these connections facilitate a dynamic interplay where the agent continuously updates its state estimates, evaluates policies, and selects actions based on real-time observations and its internal beliefs about the environment. This structure is fundamental for enabling effective decision-making in uncertain environments.
