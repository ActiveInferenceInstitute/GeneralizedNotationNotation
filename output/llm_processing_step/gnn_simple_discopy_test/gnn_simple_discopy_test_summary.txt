The GNN model titled **"Simple DisCoPy Test Model"** is designed to illustrate a basic structure within a Generalized Notation Notation (GNN) framework. 

### Key Components:
- **StateSpace**: The model comprises three primary states:
  - **X** (type=A)
  - **Y** (type=B)
  - **Z** (type=C)

### Main Connections:
- There are two significant connections between the states:
  - **X** connects to **Y**
  - **Y** connects to **Z**

### Purpose:
This model serves as a simple test case for exploring the interactions between different types of states (A, B, and C) and their sequential connections, demonstrating the foundational principles of state relationships in a GNN context.
