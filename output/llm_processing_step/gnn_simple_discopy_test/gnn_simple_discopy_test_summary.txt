### Summary of the GNN Model: Simple DisCoPy Test Model

**Model Name:** Simple DisCoPy Test Model

**Key Components:**
- **State Space:**
  - **X** (Type: A)
  - **Y** (Type: B)
  - **Z** (Type: C)

**Main Connections:**
- X is connected to Y
- Y is connected to Z

**Purpose:** 
The Simple DisCoPy Test Model is designed to illustrate the basic structure and interactions within a system using a generalized notation framework. The model consists of three distinct states (X, Y, Z) that demonstrate a sequential flow of information or influence from one state to another, emphasizing the relationships between different types of states in the system.
