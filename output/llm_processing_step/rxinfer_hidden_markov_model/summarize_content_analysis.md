### Summary of RxInfer Hidden Markov Model GNN Specification

#### 1. Model Overview
The RxInfer Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a probabilistic graphical model designed to infer hidden states based on noisy observations over time. It consists of three hidden states representing different rooms in a house and three corresponding observation categories, enabling the model to capture the dynamics of state transitions and the relationships between hidden states and observations.

#### 2. Key Variables
- **Hidden States**:
  - **Bedroom**: Represents the first hidden state where the agent may be located.
  - **Living Room**: Represents the second hidden state.
  - **Bathroom**: Represents the third hidden state.
  
- **Observations**:
  - Three categorical outcomes that correspond to the noisy observations of the true hidden states, reflecting the uncertainty in detecting the actual state.

- **Actions/Controls**: 
  - The model does not explicitly define actions; however, the transition matrix (A) governs the dynamics of state changes over time.

#### 3. Critical Parameters
- **Transition Matrix (A)**: Defines the probabilities of transitioning from one hidden state to another over time, influenced by the prior distribution specified by Dirichlet hyperparameters.
- **Observation Matrix (B)**: Specifies the emission probabilities from hidden states to observations, also governed by Dirichlet priors.
- **Initial State Distribution (s_0)**: A uniform distribution over the three hidden states, indicating no prior knowledge of the starting state.

- **Key Hyperparameters**:
  - **A_prior**: Dirichlet hyperparameters encouraging states to remain stable (e.g., strong preferences for staying in the same room).
  - **B_prior**: Uniform Dirichlet priors suggesting that observations are mostly accurate but with some noise.

#### 4. Notable Features
- The model employs Dirichlet priors for both the transition and observation matrices, facilitating Bayesian learning and inference.
- It incorporates a uniform initial state distribution, which simplifies the starting conditions for inference.
- The inference process utilizes variational message passing to approximate the posterior distributions of the hidden states and matrices.

#### 5. Use Cases
This model is applicable in scenarios where understanding the underlying state dynamics is crucial, such as:
- Tracking the movement of individuals within a structured environment (e.g., smart homes).
- Analyzing behavioral patterns based on noisy sensor data.
- Applications in robotics for localization and mapping, where the robot's position is inferred from uncertain observations.
