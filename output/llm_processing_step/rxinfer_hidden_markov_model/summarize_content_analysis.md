### Summary of the RxInfer Hidden Markov Model GNN Specification

#### 1. Model Overview
The RxInfer Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a probabilistic model designed to infer hidden states based on observed data. It consists of three hidden states and three observation categories, utilizing Bayesian learning through Dirichlet priors to update beliefs about state transitions and emissions over time.

#### 2. Key Variables
- **Hidden States**:
  - **Bedroom**: Represents the first hidden state where the agent is likely to be.
  - **Living Room**: Represents the second hidden state, indicating a different location.
  - **Bathroom**: Represents the third hidden state, another distinct location.
  
- **Observations**:
  - **Observation Category 1**: Noisy observation corresponding to the Bedroom state.
  - **Observation Category 2**: Noisy observation corresponding to the Living Room state.
  - **Observation Category 3**: Noisy observation corresponding to the Bathroom state.
  
- **Actions/Controls**: 
  - The model does not explicitly define actions but relies on the transition and observation matrices to control state dynamics and emissions.

#### 3. Critical Parameters
- **Transition Matrix (A)**: Defines the probabilities of transitioning between hidden states over time. It is influenced by prior Dirichlet hyperparameters that encourage staying in the same state.
- **Observation Matrix (B)**: Specifies the probabilities of observing each category given the current hidden state, also guided by Dirichlet priors.
- **Initial State Distribution (s_0)**: Uniformly initialized, indicating equal probability of starting in any hidden state.

- **Key Hyperparameters**:
  - **A_prior**: Dirichlet hyperparameters favoring state retention (e.g., strong preference to stay in the same room).
  - **B_prior**: Uniform priors for observations, indicating that observations are mostly accurate but include some noise.

#### 4. Notable Features
- The model employs a **Bayesian framework** with Dirichlet priors, allowing for robust learning from data.
- **Temporal dependencies** are explicitly modeled, where the current hidden state is influenced by the previous state and generates the current observation.
- The model is designed for **variational inference**, minimizing the free energy to approximate posterior distributions.

#### 5. Use Cases
This model is suitable for scenarios where one needs to infer latent states from noisy observations, such as:
- **Behavioral analysis** in smart homes, where the model can track the movement of individuals between rooms based on sensor data.
- **Health monitoring**, where states might represent different health conditions and observations could be symptoms or measurements.
- **Robotics**, where a robot's location and actions can be inferred from sensor readings in an environment with uncertainty.
