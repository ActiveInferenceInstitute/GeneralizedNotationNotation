### Summary of the GNN Model: Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Model Name:** Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Purpose:** This GNN model represents a multi-agent trajectory planning scenario designed for use with RxInfer.jl. It aims to simulate how multiple agents navigate a 2D environment while adhering to various constraints, including obstacle avoidance and collision avoidance, to reach designated targets.

**Key Components:**

1. **State Space Model:**
   - The model incorporates a state space representation for agents moving in a 2D environment, defined by:
     - **State Transition Matrix (A)**: Determines how agents transition between states over time.
     - **Control Input Matrix (B)**: Maps control inputs to state changes.
     - **Observation Matrix (C)**: Relates the state of agents to observable outputs.

2. **Primary States/Observations:**
   - Agents' positions and velocities are represented in a state vector, with observations influenced by noise characterized by defined variances for initial state, control inputs, and goal constraints.

3. **Main Connections:**
   - **Agent Trajectories**: The state space model outputs trajectories based on initial states and control variances.
   - **Goal Constraints**: Trajectories are adjusted to consider proximity to targets.
   - **Obstacle Avoidance**: Constraints are applied based on the distances to obstacles, ensuring agents avoid collisions with them.
   - **Collision Avoidance**: Interactions between agents are managed to prevent overlapping trajectories, considering their respective sizes.
   - **Planning System**: Combines goal-directed behavior, obstacle avoidance, and collision avoidance into a cohesive planning framework.

This model serves as a comprehensive framework for simulating and analyzing the complex interactions between multiple agents in dynamic environments while ensuring their safe navigation towards goals.
