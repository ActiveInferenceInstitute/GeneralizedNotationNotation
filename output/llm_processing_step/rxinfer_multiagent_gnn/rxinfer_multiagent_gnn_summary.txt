### Summary of the GNN Model: Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Model Name**: Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Purpose**: This model is designed for simulating trajectory planning in a multi-agent environment using the RxInfer.jl framework. It aims to facilitate the movement of multiple agents in a 2D environment while accounting for obstacles and ensuring collision avoidance between agents.

**Key Components**:

1. **State Space Model**:
   - **Parameters**:
     - Time step (`dt`), constraint parameter (`gamma`), number of time steps (`nr_steps`), number of agents (`nr_agents`), and others that dictate the simulation dynamics.
   - **Matrices**:
     - State transition matrix (`A`), control input matrix (`B`), and observation matrix (`C`) are defined to model agent movements and observations.

2. **Prior Distributions**:
   - Variances for initial states, control inputs, and goal constraints are established, allowing for a probabilistic representation of the model states.

3. **Agent Configurations**:
   - Each agent (four in total) is defined by unique IDs, radii, initial positions, and target positions, allowing for individual trajectory planning.

4. **Environment Definitions**:
   - Several obstacles are defined (doors, walls, and combined obstacles) to simulate realistic scenarios affecting agent trajectories.

5. **Experiment Configurations**:
   - The model includes settings for reproducibility (random seeds) and file naming conventions for saving results and visualizations.

**Main Connections**:
- The model interlinks various components to form a cohesive planning system:
  - The state space model generates agent trajectories based on control inputs and initial states.
  - Goal-directed behavior is influenced by the trajectories and goal constraints.
  - Obstacle avoidance mechanisms are integrated using distance metrics from agent positions to obstacles.
  - Collision avoidance is implemented, ensuring that agents do not occupy the same space based on their defined radii.
  - The complete planning system synthesizes these elements, facilitating coordinated movement of multiple agents.

This GNN model effectively represents a structured approach to multi-agent trajectory planning, providing a comprehensive framework for simulating and analyzing agent dynamics in complex environments.
