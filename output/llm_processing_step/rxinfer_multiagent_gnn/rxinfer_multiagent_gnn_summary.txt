### Summary of the GNN Model: Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Model Name:** Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Purpose:**  
This model is designed for simulating trajectory planning in a multi-agent scenario within a 2D environment using the RxInfer.jl framework. It incorporates features for obstacle avoidance, goal-directed behavior, and inter-agent collision avoidance, making it suitable for various environments with obstacles.

**Key Components:**

1. **State Space Model:**
   - **State Transition Matrix (A):** Defines how agents transition between states over discrete time steps.
   - **Control Input Matrix (B):** Represents the impact of control inputs on agent states.
   - **Observation Matrix (C):** Maps the state space to observable outputs.

2. **Model Parameters:**
   - **Time Step (dt):** The increment of time for state updates.
   - **Number of Agents (nr_agents):** Defines the number of agents in the simulation (set to 4).
   - **Trajectory Length (nr_steps):** The number of time steps for the trajectory (set to 40).
   - **Inference Iterations (nr_iterations):** Specifies how many iterations are used in the inference process (set to 350).

3. **Connections:**
   - **Agent Trajectories:** The output of the state space model, influenced by initial state and control variances.
   - **Goal Constraints:** Integrates goal-directed behavior by modeling the probability of reaching a target position.
   - **Obstacle Avoidance:** Models the probability distribution of agent positions concerning obstacles to prevent collisions.
   - **Collision Avoidance:** Ensures that agents maintain a safe distance from one another based on their respective radii.

The model effectively combines these components to create a comprehensive planning system that simulates the movement and interaction of multiple agents within a defined environment, adhering to specified constraints and goals.
