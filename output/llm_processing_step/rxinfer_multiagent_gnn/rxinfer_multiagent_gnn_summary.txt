### Summary of the GNN Model: Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Model Name:** Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Purpose:**  
This model is designed to simulate trajectory planning for multiple agents in a 2D environment using RxInfer.jl. It incorporates various constraints, including obstacle avoidance, goal-directed behavior, and inter-agent collision avoidance, making it suitable for complex environments with obstacles.

**Key Components:**

1. **State Space Model:**
   - **Parameters:**
     - Time step (`dt`), constraint parameter (`gamma`), number of time steps (`nr_steps`), number of agents (`nr_agents`), and softmin temperature.
   - **Matrices:**
     - State transition matrix (`A`), control input matrix (`B`), and observation matrix (`C`).
   - **Prior Distributions:**
     - Variances for initial states, control inputs, and goal constraints.

2. **Environment Definitions:**
   - Obstacles are defined for different scenarios, including door and wall environments, with parameters for center and size.

3. **Agent Configurations:**
   - Each agent is defined with an ID, radius, initial position, and target position. Four agents are configured in total, each with distinct properties.

4. **Experiment Configurations:**
   - Includes random seeds for reproducibility and file paths for saving results and visualizations.

**Main Connections:**
- The model parameters interact with the state space model to generate agent trajectories.
- The agent trajectories are utilized to enforce goal constraints and obstacle avoidance.
- The planning system integrates the outcomes of goal-directed behavior, obstacle avoidance, and collision avoidance to achieve effective trajectory planning.

This GNN model serves as a foundational structure for simulating and analyzing multi-agent interactions in trajectory planning scenarios, addressing both dynamic environment challenges and agent-specific behaviors.
