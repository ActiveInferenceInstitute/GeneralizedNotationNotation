### Summary of the GNN Model: Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Model Name:** Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Purpose:** 
The model is designed for simulating multi-agent trajectory planning in a 2D environment using RxInfer.jl. It incorporates various constraints to facilitate agents' movement while avoiding obstacles and ensuring safety during interactions with other agents.

**Key Components:**

1. **State Space Model:**
   - **Parameters:**
     - Time step (`dt`)
     - State transition matrix (`A`)
     - Control input matrix (`B`)
     - Observation matrix (`C`)
   - **State Dynamics:** Describes how agents evolve over time based on their control inputs and noise.

2. **Observations:**
   - Initial states and trajectories of agents are observed through the matrices that map the state to the observations.

3. **Constraints:**
   - **Obstacle Avoidance:** Ensures agents avoid predefined obstacles based on their positions relative to the obstacles.
   - **Goal-Directed Behavior:** Guides agents toward their target positions while accounting for noise in the observations.
   - **Inter-Agent Collision Avoidance:** Prevents agents from getting too close to each other based on their physical radii.

**Main Connections:**
- The state space model provides the foundation upon which agent trajectories are computed.
- Agent trajectories are influenced by initial state variances and control variances.
- Goal and obstacle constraints directly affect the agents' decision-making processes.
- All components converge into a complete planning system that orchestrates the agents' behavior in the environment.

This GNN model effectively integrates the dynamics of multiple agents navigating a space with obstacles, ensuring safe and efficient path planning while adhering to various constraints.
