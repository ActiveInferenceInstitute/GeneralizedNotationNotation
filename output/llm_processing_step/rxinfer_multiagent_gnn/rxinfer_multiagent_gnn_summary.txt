### Summary of the GNN Model: Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Model Name:** Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Purpose:** 
The model is designed for simulating and planning the trajectories of multiple agents in a 2D environment while accounting for obstacles, goal-directed behaviors, and inter-agent collision avoidance. It leverages the RxInfer.jl framework to facilitate inference and trajectory planning.

**Key Components:**

1. **State Space Model:**
   - **Parameters:**
     - `dt`: Time step for the model.
     - `gamma`: Constraint parameter for obstacle avoidance.
     - `nr_steps`: Number of time steps in the simulation.
     - `nr_iterations`: Number of inference iterations.
     - `nr_agents`: Number of agents involved.
   - **Matrices:**
     - `A`: State transition matrix defining how agents evolve over time.
     - `B`: Control input matrix influencing the state based on inputs.
     - `C`: Observation matrix mapping states to observed variables.

2. **Prior Distributions:**
   - Variances for initial states, control inputs, and goal constraints, along with parameters for Gamma distributions for uncertainty modeling.

3. **Visualization Parameters:**
   - Settings for plotting trajectories, including boundaries, resolution, and visual properties of agents.

4. **Environment Definitions:**
   - Specifications for obstacles in various configurations (door, wall, combined) with centers and sizes defined.

5. **Agent Configurations:**
   - Details for four agents, including their IDs, radii, initial and target positions.

6. **Experiment Configurations:**
   - Random seeds for reproducibility, results directory, and filenames for visualizations of control signals and obstacles.

**Main Connections:**
- The model establishes connections between parameters and computations, such as:
  - State evolution using the state space model and variances for initial states and controls.
  - Goal-directed behavior derived from agent trajectories and goal constraints.
  - Obstacle avoidance and collision avoidance mechanisms based on agent positions and defined constraints.
  - Integration into a complete planning system that synthesizes these components for trajectory planning.

This model provides a comprehensive framework for simulating multi-agent environments with complex interactions and constraints, ensuring effective trajectory planning while avoiding obstacles and collisions.
