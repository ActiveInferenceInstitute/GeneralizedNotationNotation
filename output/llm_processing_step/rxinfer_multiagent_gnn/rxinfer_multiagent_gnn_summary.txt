### Summary of the GNN Model: Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Model Name:** Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Purpose:**
This model is designed for simulating trajectory planning of multiple agents in a 2D environment using the RxInfer.jl framework. It incorporates obstacle avoidance, goal-directed behavior, and inter-agent collision avoidance to effectively manage the agents' movements in complex environments.

**Key Components:**

1. **State Space Model:**
   - **State Transition Matrix (A):** Defines how agent states evolve over time.
   - **Control Input Matrix (B):** Represents how control inputs affect the agents' states.
   - **Observation Matrix (C):** Maps the state variables to observable outputs.
   - **Model Parameters:** Includes time step (`dt`), constraint parameters (`gamma`), number of time steps (`nr_steps`), number of agents (`nr_agents`), and variance settings for initial state, control inputs, and goal constraints.

2. **Agent Configurations:**
   - Each agent has specific attributes such as ID, radius, initial position, and target position. This includes four agents, each with unique characteristics.

3. **Environment Definitions:**
   - Various obstacles are defined, including door obstacles, wall obstacles, and combined obstacles, which influence the agents' trajectories.

4. **Visualization Parameters:**
   - Settings for visualizing results, including plot boundaries, heatmap resolution, and color settings.

**Main Connections:**
- The model's dynamics are established through connections between components:
  - The state transition (`dt > A`) and the matrices (`A, B, C > state_space_model`) form the core of the state space model.
  - Agent trajectories are influenced by initial state variance and control variance, linking to `goal_directed_behavior` and `obstacle_avoidance`.
  - Collision avoidance is addressed through the connections between agent trajectories and the number of agents, culminating in a complete planning system that integrates goal-directed behavior, obstacle avoidance, and collision avoidance.

**Overall Model Structure:**
This GNN model effectively simulates the behavior of multiple agents navigating a 2D space, accounting for dynamic interactions with each other and their environment, while ensuring that they avoid obstacles and achieve their designated goals.
