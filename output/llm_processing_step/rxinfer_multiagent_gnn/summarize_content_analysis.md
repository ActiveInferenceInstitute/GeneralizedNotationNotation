### Model Overview
The **Multi-agent Trajectory Planning** model in RxInfer.jl is designed to simulate the movement of multiple agents in a 2D environment while considering obstacle avoidance, goal-directed behavior, and inter-agent collision avoidance. It utilizes a state space framework to predict agent trajectories over a specified time horizon, enabling efficient planning in complex environments.

### Key Variables
- **Hidden States**:
  - **Agent Positions**: Continuous state variables representing the positions of agents in the 2D space.
  
- **Observations**:
  - **Agent Observations**: Measurements derived from the hidden states, indicating the positions of agents at each time step.

- **Actions/Controls**:
  - **Control Inputs**: Actions taken by agents to move towards their target positions, influencing their trajectories.

### Critical Parameters
- **Most Important Matrices**:
  - **A (State Transition Matrix)**: Defines how the state evolves from one time step to the next based on current states and control inputs.
  - **B (Control Input Matrix)**: Maps control inputs to state changes, facilitating the influence of agent actions on their positions.
  - **C (Observation Matrix)**: Relates the hidden states to the observed outputs, allowing for the extraction of agent positions from the state space.

- **Key Hyperparameters**:
  - **dt**: Time step for the state space model, set to 1.0.
  - **gamma**: Constraint parameter for obstacle avoidance, set to 1.0.
  - **nr_steps**: Total number of time steps for trajectory planning, set to 40.
  - **nr_agents**: Number of agents in the simulation, set to 4.
  - **initial_state_variance**: Variance of the initial state, set to 100.0, indicating high uncertainty.

### Notable Features
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: The model incorporates constraints that ensure agents avoid obstacles by modeling the probability of collision based on their positions relative to obstacles.
- **Goal-directed Behavior**: Agents are programmed to move towards specified target positions, with probabilistic constraints ensuring they reach their goals while minimizing collision risks.
- **Dynamic Environment**: The model allows for the definition of various environmental obstacles, including doors and walls, which can be adjusted for different scenarios.

### Use Cases
This model is applicable in scenarios such as:
- **Robotics**: Planning trajectories for multiple robots in environments with dynamic obstacles.
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Simulating the movement of vehicles in urban settings to avoid collisions and reach destinations efficiently.
- **Game Development**: Creating AI behaviors for characters that navigate complex terrains while avoiding other characters and obstacles.
