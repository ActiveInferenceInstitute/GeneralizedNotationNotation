### Summary of GNN Specification: Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

1. **Model Overview**:  
   The Multi-agent Trajectory Planning model in RxInfer.jl simulates the movement of multiple agents in a 2D environment while considering obstacles and inter-agent interactions. It employs a state space model to facilitate trajectory planning that incorporates goal-directed behavior and collision avoidance, making it suitable for dynamic environments.

2. **Key Variables**:
   - **Hidden States**: 
     - `x_t`: Represents the state of the agents in the environment at time `t`.
   - **Observations**: 
     - `y_t`: The observed positions of the agents, derived from the hidden states.
   - **Actions/Controls**: 
     - `u_t`: Control inputs that dictate the agents' movements, influencing their trajectories.

3. **Critical Parameters**:
   - **State Transition Matrix (A)**: Defines how the state evolves over time based on the current state and control inputs. It captures the dynamics of agent movement.
   - **Control Input Matrix (B)**: Maps control inputs to state changes, determining how actions affect the agents' states.
   - **Observation Matrix (C)**: Relates the hidden states to the observations, allowing for the extraction of agent positions from the state representation.
   - **Key Hyperparameters**:
     - `dt`: Time step for the model (set to 1.0).
     - `gamma`: Constraint parameter for obstacle avoidance (set to 1.0).
     - `nr_steps`: Number of time steps in the simulation (set to 40).
     - `nr_agents`: Number of agents in the simulation (set to 4).

4. **Notable Features**:
   - The model incorporates **obstacle avoidance** and **collision avoidance** constraints, ensuring agents navigate safely in the environment.
   - It allows for **goal-directed behavior**, where agents are programmed to reach specific target positions.
   - The design supports **dynamic environments** with multiple types of obstacles, including doors and walls, enhancing its applicability to real-world scenarios.

5. **Use Cases**:  
   This model can be applied in scenarios such as robotic navigation in crowded spaces, autonomous vehicle trajectory planning, and simulations for multi-agent systems in environments with obstacles. It is particularly useful for testing algorithms in dynamic and uncertain settings where agents must adapt to changing conditions while avoiding collisions.
