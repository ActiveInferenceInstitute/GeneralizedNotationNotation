### Model Overview
The **Multi-agent Trajectory Planning** model in RxInfer.jl is designed to simulate the trajectories of multiple agents navigating a 2D environment while avoiding obstacles and other agents. It incorporates goal-directed behavior, obstacle avoidance, and collision avoidance constraints, enabling the evaluation of complex interactions in dynamic environments.

### Key Variables
- **Hidden States**:
  - **Agent Positions**: The current positions of agents in the 2D space.
  - **Agent Velocities**: The velocities of agents influencing their movement.
  
- **Observations**:
  - **Agent Observations**: Measurements of agent positions relative to their targets and obstacles.
  
- **Actions/Controls**:
  - **Control Inputs**: Inputs that dictate the movement of agents, influencing their trajectories.

### Critical Parameters
- **State Transition Matrix (A)**: Defines how the state of agents evolves over time, incorporating the time step and maintaining the system's dynamics.
- **Control Input Matrix (B)**: Maps control inputs to state changes, allowing for the integration of actions into the state evolution.
- **Observation Matrix (C)**: Relates the hidden states to the observed outputs, facilitating the measurement of agent positions and velocities.

- **Key Hyperparameters**:
  - **dt**: Time step for the state space model (set to 1.0).
  - **gamma**: Constraint parameter for obstacle avoidance (set to 1.0).
  - **nr_steps**: Number of time steps in the simulation (set to 40).
  - **nr_agents**: Number of agents in the simulation (set to 4).
  - **initial_state_variance**: Variance for the initial state distribution (set to 100.0).

### Notable Features
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: The model includes probabilistic constraints that ensure agents avoid obstacles based on their positions and the distances to obstacles.
- **Collision Avoidance**: It incorporates a mechanism to prevent agents from colliding with each other by considering their radii and relative positions.
- **Dynamic Environment**: The model allows for varying configurations of obstacles, enabling simulations in different environments.

### Use Cases
This model can be applied in scenarios such as:
- **Robotics**: Planning paths for multiple robots in shared spaces, ensuring safe navigation.
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Simulating the movement of vehicles in urban environments with obstacles and other vehicles.
- **Game Development**: Creating intelligent agents that navigate complex terrains while avoiding collisions and achieving goals.
