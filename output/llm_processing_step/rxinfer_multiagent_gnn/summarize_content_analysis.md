### Model Overview
The **Multi-agent Trajectory Planning** model in RxInfer.jl is designed to simulate the movement of multiple agents in a 2D environment while considering obstacles, goal-directed behavior, and inter-agent collision avoidance. This model employs a state space framework to predict agent trajectories over discrete time steps, facilitating the planning of paths that avoid obstacles and each other.

### Key Variables
- **Hidden States**:
  - **Agent Positions**: The current positions of agents in the 2D space, represented in a state vector.
  - **Agent Velocities**: The velocities of agents, influencing their movement dynamics over time.

- **Observations**:
  - **Agent Positions**: Observed positions of agents, which are subject to noise represented by a Gaussian distribution.
  - **Control Inputs**: The inputs that influence agent movements, which are also observed with uncertainty.

- **Actions/Controls**:
  - **Control Inputs (u)**: Actions taken by agents to move towards their target positions, affecting their trajectories.

### Critical Parameters
- **State Transition Matrix (A)**: Defines how the state of the system evolves over time, incorporating the effects of control inputs and noise.
- **Control Input Matrix (B)**: Maps control inputs to state changes, specifying how actions influence agent positions.
- **Observation Matrix (C)**: Relates the hidden states to the observed outputs, allowing for the estimation of agent positions from noisy observations.

- **Key Hyperparameters**:
  - **Time Step (dt)**: Set to 1.0, defining the discrete time intervals for the simulation.
  - **Number of Agents (nr_agents)**: Set to 4, indicating the number of agents in the environment.
  - **Number of Time Steps (nr_steps)**: Set to 40, determining the duration of the simulation.
  - **Inference Iterations (nr_iterations)**: Set to 350, specifying the number of iterations for belief updating in the inference process.

### Notable Features
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: The model incorporates constraints to ensure agents avoid obstacles, modeled as Gaussian distributions based on the distance to the nearest obstacle.
- **Goal-directed Behavior**: Agents are programmed to move towards specific target positions while minimizing the variance around their goals.
- **Collision Avoidance**: The model includes mechanisms to prevent agents from colliding with each other, taking into account their respective radii.

### Use Cases
This model can be applied in scenarios such as:
- Autonomous vehicle navigation in urban environments with obstacles.
- Robotics applications where multiple robots must coordinate their movements in shared spaces.
- Simulation of crowd dynamics where individuals must navigate around obstacles and each other efficiently.
