### 1. Model Overview
The Federated Inference Multi-Agent Belief Sharing Model, as described by Friston et al. (2023), simulates a system where three sentinel agents collaboratively share beliefs about their environment to minimize joint free energy. Each agent possesses a restricted field of view and communicates posterior beliefs to enhance collective understanding and decision-making, demonstrating principles of distributed cognition and active inference.

### 2. Key Variables
- **Hidden States**:
  - **s_location**: Allocentric position of the agent (9 discrete states).
  - **s_proximity**: Distance to other entities (2 states: close, near).
  - **s_pose**: Disposition towards others (2 states: foe, friend).
  - **s_gaze_a1, s_gaze_a2, s_gaze_a3**: Gaze direction for each agent (3 states: left, center, right).

- **Observations**:
  - **o_vis_subject_a1, o_vis_subject_a2, o_vis_subject_a3**: Visual detection of subjects within the agents' fields of view.
  - **o_vis_center_a1, o_vis_center_a2, o_vis_center_a3**: Central contrast observations.
  - **o_vis_left_a1, o_vis_left_a2, o_vis_left_a3**: Left peripheral observations.
  - **o_vis_right_a1, o_vis_right_a2, o_vis_right_a3**: Right peripheral observations.
  - **o_proprioceptive_a1, o_proprioceptive_a2, o_proprioceptive_a3**: Gaze direction observations.
  - **o_comm_location_a1, o_comm_location_a2, o_comm_location_a3**: Broadcasted location information.
  - **o_comm_proximity_a1, o_comm_proximity_a2, o_comm_proximity_a3**: Broadcasted proximity information.
  - **o_comm_pose_a1, o_comm_pose_a2, o_comm_pose_a3**: Broadcasted pose information.

- **Actions/Controls**:
  - **u_gaze_a1, u_gaze_a2, u_gaze_a3**: Chosen gaze actions for each agent.
  - **π_gaze_a1, π_gaze_a2, π_gaze_a3**: Policy distributions over gaze actions for each agent.

### 3. Critical Parameters
- **Most Important Matrices**:
  - **A Matrices**: Likelihood matrices for observations, including visual (subject detection, contrast) and auditory (communication) mappings.
  - **B Matrices**: Transition matrices governing the dynamics of hidden states, including location, proximity, pose, and gaze transitions.
  - **C Matrices**: Prior preference vectors influencing agents' preferences over observations and communications.
  - **D Matrices**: Prior state distributions representing initial beliefs about hidden states (uniform distributions across states).

- **Key Hyperparameters**:
  - **τ_learning**: 32.0 (learning timescale parameter).
  - **η_precision**: 4.0 (precision parameter for belief sharing).
  - **γ_attention**: 2.0 (attentional precision parameter).

### 4. Notable Features
- The model incorporates a federated inference framework, allowing agents to share beliefs and minimize joint free energy through communication.
- Each agent operates with a restricted field of view, simulating real-world constraints on perception and interaction.
- The design emphasizes active inference, where agents engage in epistemic foraging and communication to enhance collective intelligence and decision-making.

### 5. Use Cases
This model can be applied in scenarios involving multi-agent systems where collaboration and belief sharing are crucial, such as in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and social cognition studies. It is particularly relevant for exploring dynamics of communication, language acquisition, and collective decision-making in environments with limited observational capabilities.
