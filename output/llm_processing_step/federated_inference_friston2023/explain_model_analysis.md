### 1. Model Purpose
The **Federated Inference Multi-Agent Belief Sharing Model** represents a sophisticated framework for understanding how multiple agents (in this case, three sentinel agents) can collaboratively infer and share beliefs about their environment. This model is grounded in the principles of **Active Inference**, which posits that agents minimize their expected free energy by updating beliefs based on sensory observations and communicating these beliefs to one another. The real-world phenomena this model captures include distributed cognition, language acquisition, and collective intelligence, particularly in scenarios where agents have limited fields of view and must rely on communication to enhance their understanding of a shared environment.

### 2. Core Components
- **Hidden States**:
  - **s_location**: Represents the allocentric position of the agents in a circular arrangement (9 possible states).
  - **s_proximity**: Indicates the distance between agents and potential subjects (2 states: close and near).
  - **s_pose**: Reflects the agents' perception of their relationship with others (2 states: friend or foe).
  - **s_gaze_a1, s_gaze_a2, s_gaze_a3**: Capture the gaze direction of each agent, with 3 options (left, center, right).

- **Observations**:
  - **o_vis_subject_a1, o_vis_subject_a2, o_vis_subject_a3**: Capture visual detections of subjects within the agents' line of sight, influenced by their location and pose.
  - **o_vis_center_a1, o_vis_center_a2, o_vis_center_a3**: Represent central contrast observations, indicating the presence or absence of subjects.
  - **o_proprioceptive_a1, o_proprioceptive_a2, o_proprioceptive_a3**: Capture the agents' self-reported gaze direction.
  - **o_comm_location_a1, o_comm_location_a2, o_comm_location_a3**: Reflect the agents' communicated beliefs about their locations.
  - **o_comm_proximity_a1, o_comm_proximity_a2, o_comm_proximity_a3**: Capture communicated beliefs about proximity.
  - **o_comm_pose_a1, o_comm_pose_a2, o_comm_pose_a3**: Reflect communicated beliefs about the agents' poses.

- **Actions/Controls**:
  - **u_gaze_a1, u_gaze_a2, u_gaze_a3**: Control the gaze direction of each agent, allowing them to look left, center, or right.
  - **π_gaze_a1, π_gaze_a2, π_gaze_a3**: Represent the policy distributions over gaze actions, determining the likelihood of each gaze direction based on the agents' beliefs and expected free energy.

### 3. Model Dynamics
The model operates in a discrete time framework where the hidden states evolve based on the agents' actions and the environmental dynamics. The key relationships include:
- **Temporal Transitions**: Hidden states evolve over time according to transition matrices (B matrices) that dictate how states change based on actions (e.g., moving left or right, changing gaze).
- **Observation Likelihoods**: The observations depend on the hidden states through likelihood matrices (A matrices), which define how sensory inputs relate to the agents' beliefs about their environment.
- **Belief Updates**: The agents update their posterior beliefs based on their observations and the communicated beliefs from other agents, which are influenced by the precision of communication (η_precision).

### 4. Active Inference Context
This model embodies the principles of **Active Inference** by:
- **Minimizing Expected Free Energy**: Each agent seeks to minimize its expected free energy (G_a1, G_a2, G_a3) by selecting actions that lead to the most informative observations while also considering the beliefs shared by other agents.
- **Updating Beliefs**: The agents update their beliefs (q_location, q_proximity, q_pose, q_gaze) based on new observations and the communicated beliefs from other agents. This is formalized through the belief-sharing update mechanism, where the posterior beliefs are adjusted according to the likelihood of observations and the beliefs of other agents.
- **Epistemic Foraging**: The agents engage in epistemic foraging, where they actively seek information that reduces uncertainty about their environment, thereby enhancing collective understanding.

### 5. Practical Implications
Using this model, one can:
- **Predict Collective Behavior**: The model can simulate how agents will behave in a shared environment, providing insights into how distributed cognition emerges from individual actions and beliefs.
- **Inform Decision-Making**: By understanding how agents share beliefs and update their knowledge, one can design better communication protocols for multi-agent systems, enhancing collaboration in complex tasks.
- **Explore Learning Dynamics**: The model allows for the exploration of how agents learn from their environment and from each other, which can inform theories on language acquisition and cultural transmission.
- **Evaluate Communication Strategies**: The effectiveness of different communication strategies can be assessed, helping to optimize information sharing in social or organizational contexts.

In summary, the **Federated Inference Multi-Agent Belief Sharing Model** provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how agents can collaboratively infer and share beliefs, with implications for various fields, including cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and social dynamics.
