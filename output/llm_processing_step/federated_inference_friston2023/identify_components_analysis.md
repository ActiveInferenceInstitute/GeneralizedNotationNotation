The provided GNN specification outlines a complex federated inference model based on Active Inference principles, focusing on belief sharing among multiple agents. Below is a systematic breakdown of the model components as requested:

### 1. **State Variables (Hidden States)**:
   - **Variable Names and Dimensions**:
     - `s_location[9,1]`: Allocentric position (9 discrete states).
     - `s_proximity[2,1]`: Proximity (2 discrete states: close, near).
     - `s_pose[2,1]`: Disposition (2 discrete states: foe, friend).
     - `s_gaze_a1[3,1]`, `s_gaze_a2[3,1]`, `s_gaze_a3[3,1]`: Gaze direction for each agent (3 discrete states: left, center, right).
     - `s_prime_location[9,1]`, `s_prime_proximity[2,1]`, `s_prime_pose[2,1]`, `s_prime_gaze_a1[3,1]`, `s_prime_gaze_a2[3,1]`, `s_prime_gaze_a3[3,1]`: Next time step states for each hidden variable.

   - **Conceptual Representation**:
     - `s_location`: Represents the spatial positioning of agents in a circular arrangement.
     - `s_proximity`: Indicates the distance between agents and potential subjects.
     - `s_pose`: Reflects the agents' social stance towards others (friend or foe).
     - `s_gaze`: Captures the attentional focus of each agent, influencing their observations.

   - **State Space Structure**:
     - The state space is discrete and finite, with defined states for each hidden variable, allowing for structured inference and belief updates.

### 2. **Observation Variables**:
   - **Observation Modalities**:
     - **Visual Observations**:
       - `o_vis_subject_a1[6,1]`, `o_vis_center_a1[3,1]`, `o_vis_left_a1[3,1]`, `o_vis_right_a1[3,1]`: Subject detection and contrast observations for Agent 1.
       - Similar structures exist for Agents 2 and 3.
     - **Proprioceptive Observations**:
       - `o_proprioceptive_a1[3,1]`: Gaze direction observation for Agent 1 (and similarly for others).
     - **Auditory Communication Observations**:
       - `o_comm_location_a1[9,1]`, `o_comm_proximity_a1[2,1]`, `o_comm_pose_a1[2,1]`: Communication broadcasts from Agent 1 (and similarly for others).

   - **Sensor/Measurement Interpretations**:
     - Each observation variable corresponds to specific sensory modalities, capturing the agents' perceptions of their environment and their internal states.

   - **Noise Models/Uncertainty Characterization**:
     - The model assumes some level of noise in observations, particularly in communication, which may be represented as additive noise in the communication equations.

### 3. **Action/Control Variables**:
   - **Available Actions**:
     - `u_gaze_a1[1]`, `u_gaze_a2[1]`, `u_gaze_a3[1]`: Chosen gaze actions for each agent (1D integer indicating the direction).
   - **Control Policies**:
     - `π_gaze_a1[3]`, `π_gaze_a2[3]`, `π_gaze_a3[3]`: Policy distributions over gaze actions, representing the probability of selecting each gaze direction.
   - **Action Space Properties**:
     - The action space is discrete with three possible actions (gaze directions) for each agent, allowing for controlled attention shifts.

### 4. **Model Matrices**:
   - **A Matrices (Observation Models)**:
     - `A_vis_subject_a1[6,9,2,2,3]`: Models the likelihood of observing subjects based on hidden states.
     - `A_comm_location[9,9]`, `A_comm_proximity[2,2]`, `A_comm_pose[2,2]`: Identity matrices for communication, indicating perfect transmission of beliefs.
   - **B Matrices (Transition Dynamics)**:
     - `B_location[9,9,3]`: Transition dynamics for location with three movement patterns.
     - `B_proximity[2,2,1]`, `B_pose[2,2,1]`: Uncontrolled transitions for proximity and pose.
     - `B_gaze_a1[3,3,3]`, `B_gaze_a2[3,3,3]`, `B_gaze_a3[3,3,3]`: Controllable gaze transitions for each agent.
   - **C Matrices (Preferences/Goals)**:
     - `C_vis_foveal[3]`, `C_vis_contrast[3]`, `C_comm_location[9]`, `C_comm_proximity[2]`, `C_comm_pose[2]`, `C_proprioceptive[3]`: Preference vectors indicating agents' biases towards certain observations or communications.
   - **D Matrices (Prior Beliefs)**:
     - `D_location[9]`, `D_proximity[2]`, `D_pose[2]`, `D_gaze_a1[3]`, `D_gaze_a2[3]`, `D_gaze_a3[3]`: Prior distributions over initial states, typically uniform.

### 5. **Parameters and Hyperparameters**:
   - **Precision Parameters**:
     - `η_precision[1]`: Precision of belief sharing communication.
     - `γ_attention[1]`: Attentional precision for epistemic foraging.
   - **Learning Rates and Adaptation Parameters**:
     - `τ_learning[1]`: Learning timescale parameter.
   - **Fixed vs. Learnable Parameters**:
     - Most matrices (A, B, C, D) are fixed, while some parameters (e.g., precision parameters) can be adjusted based on learning and experience.

### 6. **Temporal Structure**:
   - **Time Horizons and Temporal Dependencies**:
     - The model operates in discrete time steps (`t[1]`), allowing for sequential updates of beliefs and states.
   - **Dynamic vs. Static Components**:
     - The model is dynamic, with state transitions and belief updates occurring at each time step based on observations and actions.

This structured breakdown highlights the complexity and interrelatedness of the components in the federated inference model, illustrating how they contribute to the overall functionality of belief sharing and active inference among agents.
