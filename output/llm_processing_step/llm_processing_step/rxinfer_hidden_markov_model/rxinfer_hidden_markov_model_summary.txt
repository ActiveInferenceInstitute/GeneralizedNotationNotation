### Summary of the RxInfer Hidden Markov Model GNN

**Model Name:** RxInfer Hidden Markov Model v1

**Purpose:** This model implements a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) designed for the RxInfer.jl framework, focusing on inferring hidden states over time based on noisy observations. It is structured to learn from data using Bayesian methods, with Dirichlet priors applied to both the transition and observation matrices.

**Key Components:**
- **Hidden States:** The model has 3 hidden states representing rooms in a house:
  - State 1: "Bedroom"
  - State 2: "Living room"
  - State 3: "Bathroom"
  
- **Observation Categories:** There are 3 discrete outcomes corresponding to observations of the hidden states.

- **Matrices:**
  - **Transition Matrix (A):** Dictates the probabilities of transitioning from one hidden state to another over time.
  - **Observation Matrix (B):** Defines the probabilities of observing specific outcomes given the current hidden state.
  - **Dirichlet Priors:** Used for both matrices to facilitate Bayesian learning.

- **Initial State Distribution:** The model starts with a uniform distribution over the three hidden states.

**Main Connections:**
- The model establishes connections between the prior specifications and the corresponding matrices (A, B).
- The initial state influences the first hidden state, while the transition matrix governs the evolution of hidden states over time.
- Hidden states generate observations based on the observation matrix.
- Temporal dependencies are modeled where the previous state influences the current state and the current state generates the current observation.
- Inference connections allow for the derivation of posterior distributions from observations, contributing to the calculation of free energy.

This model is structured for variational inference, allowing for iterative updates to estimates of the transition and observation matrices, ultimately aiding in accurately inferring the hidden states based on observed data.
