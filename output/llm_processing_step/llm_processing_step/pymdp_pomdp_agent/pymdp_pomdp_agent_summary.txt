### Summary of the GNN Model: Multifactor PyMDP Agent

**Model Name:** Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Purpose:** This model represents a PyMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) agent designed for active inference with multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors. It aims to facilitate decision-making by integrating various sources of observations and managing hidden states through a structured framework.

**Key Components:**

1. **Observation Modalities:**
   - **State Observation:** 3 possible outcomes.
   - **Reward:** 3 possible outcomes.
   - **Decision Proprioceptive:** 3 possible outcomes.

2. **Hidden State Factors:**
   - **Reward Level:** 2 states.
   - **Decision State:** 3 states, which is controllable with 3 possible actions.

3. **Control Mechanics:**
   - The decision state factor (factor 1) is controllable, while the reward level factor (factor 0) is not.

**Main Connections:**
- The model connects hidden state factors to observation modalities and control actions:
  - Hidden states (s_f0, s_f1) influence the likelihood matrices (A_m0, A_m1, A_m2) for observations.
  - Action taken for the decision state (u_f1) affects the transition dynamics (B_f1) of the decision state factor while being linked to the expected free energy (G).
  - The expected free energy (G) also influences the policy vector (Ï€_f1), which represents the distribution over actions for the controllable factor.

**Dynamic Structure:**
- The model operates in a discrete time framework with an unbounded time horizon, allowing continuous interaction and adaptation based on observations and actions.

This GNN representation encapsulates the complex interactions between observations, hidden states, and control mechanisms, enabling the agent to infer states, make policy decisions, and sample actions effectively.
