### Summary of the GNN Model: Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Model Name:** Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Purpose:** This model represents a PyMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) agent designed for active inference with multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors. It is structured to facilitate decision-making based on various types of sensory input and internal state representations.

**Key Components:**
1. **Observation Modalities:** 
   - **State Observation:** 3 outcomes
   - **Reward:** 3 outcomes
   - **Decision Proprioceptive:** 3 outcomes

2. **Hidden State Factors:**
   - **Reward Level:** 2 states
   - **Decision State:** 3 states
   - The decision state is controllable, allowing for 3 possible actions.

3. **Matrices and Vectors:**
   - **A Matrices (Likelihoods):** 
     - A_m0 for state observations
     - A_m1 for rewards
     - A_m2 for decision proprioception
   - **B Matrices (Transitions):** 
     - B_f0 for the reward level factor (uncontrolled)
     - B_f1 for the decision state factor (controlled)
   - **C Vectors (Preferences):** 
     - C_m0, C_m1, and C_m2 for each observation modality
   - **D Vectors (Priors):** 
     - D_f0 and D_f1 for the hidden state factors

4. **Hidden States:**
   - s_f0 for "reward_level"
   - s_f1 for "decision_state"
   - Next states: s_prime_f0 and s_prime_f1

5. **Observations:**
   - o_m0, o_m1, and o_m2 corresponding to each modality

6. **Policy and Control:**
   - π_f1 for the action distribution of the controllable factor
   - u_f1 for the action taken
   - G representing the Expected Free Energy

**Main Connections:**
- The model connects hidden states (s_f0, s_f1) with observation modalities (A_m0, A_m1, A_m2) to facilitate the inference of states based on sensory information.
- The control dynamics are structured such that actions influence the transitions between states (B_f1), while the reward level transitions (B_f0) remain uncontrolled.
- The expected free energy (G) is computed based on preferences (C vectors) and informs the policy (π_f1) for decision-making.

This GNN model serves as a foundational representation for implementing a multifactor active inference agent in complex environments, integrating multiple sensory modalities and internal state factors to optimize decision-making processes.
