### Summary of the Multifactor PyMDP Agent GNN Model

**Model Name:** Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Purpose:**  
This model represents a PyMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) agent designed to operate with multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors. It employs the Active Inference framework to infer states, policies, and actions in dynamic environments.

**Key Components:**

1. **Observation Modalities:**
   - **State Observation:** 3 outcomes
   - **Reward:** 3 outcomes
   - **Decision Proprioceptive:** 3 outcomes

2. **Hidden State Factors:**
   - **Reward Level:** 2 states
   - **Decision State:** 3 states

3. **Control:** 
   - The "decision_state" factor is controllable with 3 possible actions.

**Main Connections:**
- **Hidden States and Observations:**
  - The hidden states (`s_f0` and `s_f1`) are linked to the observation likelihood matrices (`A_m0`, `A_m1`, `A_m2`), indicating how observations depend on the hidden states.
  
- **State Transitions:**
  - The state transition matrices (`B_f0` and `B_f1`) connect previous hidden states to future hidden states, with `B_f1` influenced by the action taken (`u_f1`).
  
- **Policy and Free Energy:**
  - The expected free energy (`G`) is derived from the log preference vectors (`C_m0`, `C_m1`, `C_m2`) and informs the policy distribution (`Ï€_f1`) for the controllable factor.

**Overall Structure:**
The model's architecture facilitates the inference of hidden states based on observations, the generation of policies for decision-making, and the sampling of actions in a dynamic and uncertain environment. The interactions among the components are designed to enable effective decision-making and learning in response to various stimuli.
