The **Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1** is a GNN (Generalized Notation Notation) model designed to represent a PyMDP agent that utilizes multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors within an Active Inference framework. 

### Key Components:

- **Model Name**: Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1
- **Observation Modalities**:
  - **State Observation**: 3 outcomes
  - **Reward**: 3 outcomes
  - **Decision Proprioceptive**: 3 outcomes
- **Hidden State Factors**:
  - **Reward Level**: 2 states
  - **Decision State**: 3 states
- **Control**: The decision state factor is controllable with 3 possible actions.

### Main Connections:
1. The priors for hidden states (D_f0 and D_f1) are linked to the hidden states (s_f0 and s_f1).
2. The hidden states influence the likelihood matrices (A_m0, A_m1, A_m2) which generate the observations (o_m0, o_m1, o_m2).
3. The hidden states and the chosen action (u_f1) affect the transition matrices (B_f0 and B_f1) which determine the next hidden states (s_prime_f0 and s_prime_f1).
4. Preferences (C_m0, C_m1, C_m2) contribute to calculating the Expected Free Energy (G), which further informs the action policy (Ï€_f1).
5. The expected free energy directly influences the chosen action.

### Purpose:
The model serves to facilitate state inference, policy inference, and action sampling in a multifactor decision-making context, providing a structured approach to understanding the dynamics of an agent's interactions with its environment. The agent operates under a dynamic framework with discrete time steps, aimed at unbounded model time horizons to accommodate extensive simulation scenarios.
