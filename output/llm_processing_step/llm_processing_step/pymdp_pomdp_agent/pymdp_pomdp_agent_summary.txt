### Summary of the GNN Model: Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Model Name:** Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Purpose:**  
This model represents a PyMDP agent that utilizes multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors to facilitate active inference. It is designed to help in decision-making processes by integrating various forms of sensory inputs and underlying state estimations.

**Key Components:**

1. **Observation Modalities:**
   - **State Observation:** 3 outcomes
   - **Reward:** 3 outcomes
   - **Decision Proprioceptive:** 3 outcomes

2. **Hidden State Factors:**
   - **Reward Level:** 2 states
   - **Decision State:** 3 states

3. **Control Mechanism:**
   - The decision state factor is controllable, allowing for 3 possible actions.

**Main Connections:**
- The model defines a structured relationship among its components:
  - **Hidden States to Observation Likelihoods:** The hidden states (reward level and decision state) influence the observation modalities.
  - **State Transitions:** The transition dynamics between hidden states are influenced by the actions taken (with a distinction between controlled and uncontrolled transitions).
  - **Preferences to Expected Free Energy:** The preferences for each observation modality contribute to the calculation of expected free energy, which in turn informs the policy for the controllable decision state.

This multifactor agent framework emphasizes the integration of diverse observational data and the dynamic interaction between hidden states and actions, facilitating robust decision-making in uncertain environments.
