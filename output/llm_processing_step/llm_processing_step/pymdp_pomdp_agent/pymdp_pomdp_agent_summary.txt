### Summary of the Multifactor PyMDP Agent GNN Model

**Model Name:**  
Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Purpose:**  
This model represents a PyMDP (Probabilistic Markov Decision Process) agent utilizing multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors to facilitate active inference.

**Key Components:**

1. **Observation Modalities:**
   - **state_observation:** 3 outcomes
   - **reward:** 3 outcomes
   - **decision_proprioceptive:** 3 outcomes

2. **Hidden State Factors:**
   - **reward_level:** 2 states (uncontrolled)
   - **decision_state:** 3 states (controllable with 3 possible actions)

3. **Control and Policy:**
   - The **decision_state** factor is controlled by a policy distribution over actions.
   - An expected free energy (G) is calculated to guide decision-making.

**Main Connections:**
- The hidden states (s_f0 and s_f1) are influenced by the prior distributions (D_f0 and D_f1) and affect the likelihood matrices (A_m0, A_m1, A_m2) corresponding to the observation modalities.
- Observations (o_m0, o_m1, o_m2) are derived from the likelihoods defined in the A matrices.
- The transitions between hidden states (B_f0 for reward_level and B_f1 for decision_state) are influenced by actions taken (u_f1) and the current state.
- The expected free energy (G) integrates the preferences from the C vectors and impacts the policy (Ï€_f1), which in turn determines the action (u_f1).

Overall, this model encapsulates a framework for a multifactor agent capable of processing various types of observations and making decisions based on hidden states to maximize its expected outcomes.
