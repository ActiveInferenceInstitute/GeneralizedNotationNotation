### Summary of the Multifactor PyMDP Agent GNN Model

**Model Name:** Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Purpose:**
This model represents a PyMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) agent that incorporates multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors, designed for active inference tasks. It aims to facilitate state inference, policy inference, and action sampling in dynamic environments.

**Key Components:**

1. **Observation Modalities:**
   - **State Observation:** 3 outcomes
   - **Reward:** 3 outcomes
   - **Decision Proprioceptive:** 3 outcomes

2. **Hidden State Factors:**
   - **Reward Level:** 2 states
   - **Decision State:** 3 states

3. **Control:**
   - The **decision_state** factor is controllable with 3 possible actions.

**Main Connections:**
- The model establishes connections between hidden states and observations through likelihood matrices (A_m) that define how observations relate to hidden states.
- The transitions between hidden states are governed by transition matrices (B_f), where **B_f0** is uncontrolled and **B_f1** responds to actions dictated by the policy.
- Preferences for each observation modality are specified in vectors (C_m), while priors for hidden states are defined in vectors (D_f).
- The model calculates **Expected Free Energy (G)** based on the connections from preferences and hidden states, influencing the action policy (Ï€_f1), which in turn defines the action taken (u_f1).

Overall, the Multifactor PyMDP Agent serves as a sophisticated framework for modeling decision-making processes in uncertain environments, leveraging multiple observation sources and state factors to optimize actions based on inferred states.
