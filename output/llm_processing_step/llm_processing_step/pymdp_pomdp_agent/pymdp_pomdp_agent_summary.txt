### Summary of the Multifactor PyMDP Agent GNN Model

**Model Name**: Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Purpose**: This model represents a PyMDP (Probabilistic Markov Decision Process) agent that is designed to operate with multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors. It employs the Active Inference framework to infer states, policies, and actions.

**Key Components**:

1. **Observation Modalities**:
   - **State Observation**: 3 outcomes
   - **Reward**: 3 outcomes
   - **Decision Proprioceptive**: 3 outcomes

2. **Hidden State Factors**:
   - **Reward Level**: 2 states
   - **Decision State**: 3 states (controllable with 3 possible actions)

3. **Matrices and Vectors**:
   - **A_matrices**: Likelihood matrices for each observation modality (A_m0, A_m1, A_m2)
   - **B_matrices**: Transition matrices for hidden state factors (B_f0 for "reward_level" and B_f1 for "decision_state")
   - **C_vectors**: Preference vectors for each modality (C_m0, C_m1, C_m2)
   - **D_vectors**: Priors for hidden states (D_f0, D_f1)

4. **Hidden States**:
   - **s_f0**: Hidden state for "reward_level"
   - **s_f1**: Hidden state for "decision_state"

5. **Observations**:
   - **o_m0**: Observation for modality 0
   - **o_m1**: Observation for modality 1
   - **o_m2**: Observation for modality 2

6. **Policy and Control**:
   - **π_f1**: Policy vector for controllable factor
   - **u_f1**: Action taken for controllable factor
   - **G**: Expected Free Energy

**Main Connections**:
- The hidden state factors (D_f0, D_f1) influence the observation modalities (A_m0, A_m1, A_m2).
- Observations (o_m0, o_m1, o_m2) are derived from the hidden states.
- The decision state (s_f1) and its associated action (u_f1) primarily affect the transitions in B_f1, while B_f0 remains uncontrolled.
- The overall expected free energy (G) is influenced by the preference vectors (C_m0, C_m1, C_m2) and is used to determine the policy (π_f1).

This model is structured to facilitate the understanding and implementation of decision-making processes in complex environments through probabilistic inference methods.
