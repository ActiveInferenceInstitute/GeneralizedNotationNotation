### Summary of the Multifactor PyMDP Agent GNN Model

**Model Name:** Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Purpose:** 
This model represents a PyMDP (Probabilistic Markov Decision Process) agent designed for active inference, incorporating multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors. It aims to facilitate decision-making processes in uncertain environments by leveraging a multifactor approach.

**Key Components:**

1. **Observation Modalities:**
   - **State Observation:** 3 outcomes
   - **Reward:** 3 outcomes
   - **Decision Proprioceptive:** 3 outcomes

2. **Hidden State Factors:**
   - **Reward Level:** 2 states
   - **Decision State:** 3 states
   - The decision state factor is controllable with 3 possible actions.

3. **State Transition and Likelihood Matrices:**
   - **Likelihood Matrices (A_m):**
     - A_m0: Likelihood for state observations
     - A_m1: Likelihood for rewards
     - A_m2: Likelihood for decision proprioception
   - **Transition Matrices (B_f):**
     - B_f0: Transitions for reward level (uncontrolled)
     - B_f1: Transitions for decision state (controlled by actions)

4. **Preference and Prior Vectors:**
   - **Preference Vectors (C_m):** Indicate preferences for each observation modality.
   - **Prior Vectors (D_f):** Represent prior distributions over hidden states for each factor.

5. **Hidden States:**
   - **s_f0:** Hidden state for reward level
   - **s_f1:** Hidden state for decision state

6. **Observations:**
   - **o_m0, o_m1, o_m2:** Observations corresponding to each modality.

7. **Policy and Control:**
   - **Policy Vector (Ï€_f1):** Distribution over actions for the decision state.
   - **Action Factor (u_f1):** Represents the action taken for the decision state.
   - **Expected Free Energy (G):** Represents the agent's overall expected free energy, influencing the policy.

**Main Connections:**
- The model defines a network of connections linking hidden states to observations, transitioning dynamics between states, and actions affecting state transitions.
- Connections include:
  - Hidden states influencing likelihood matrices for observations.
  - Actions taken impacting state transitions in the decision state.
  - The relationship between preferences and expected free energy guiding policy decisions.

Overall, this GNN model is structured to enable the agent to infer states, derive policies, and sample actions effectively, adapting to the complexities of its environment through active inference.
