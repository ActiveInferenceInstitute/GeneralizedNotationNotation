### Summary of the GNN Model: Comprehensive Self-Driving Car Agent

**Model Name:**  
Comprehensive Self-Driving Car Agent v1

**Purpose:**  
This model represents a complete autonomous vehicle system that utilizes Active Inference principles, focusing on multi-modal perception, vehicle dynamics, environmental modeling, and safety-critical decision-making for autonomous driving applications.

**Key Components:**

1. **Primary States/Observations:**
   - **Vehicle Dynamics State Variables:** Includes position (x, y), heading, velocities (longitudinal, lateral, angular), steering angle, throttle position, brake pressure, and gear state.
   - **Environmental State Factors:** Encompasses traffic conditions (density, flow rate, average speed), weather (condition, visibility, surface), and environmental hazards (construction zones, emergency vehicles).
   - **Multi-Agent Environment State:** Tracks positions, velocities, intentions, and classifications of other vehicles, as well as pedestrian states.
   - **Route and Navigation State:** Contains route waypoints, distances to waypoints, destination coordinates, and navigation metrics (distance to destination, estimated time of arrival).
   - **Observation Modalities:** Incorporates data from various sensors including cameras, LiDAR, radar, GPS, and IMU, providing comprehensive situational awareness.
   - **Action/Control Variables:** Represents primary and secondary control actions such as steering, acceleration, braking, and behavioral modes.

2. **Main Connections:**
   - **Primary Perception Connections:** Multi-modal sensor fusion integrates data from cameras, LiDAR, and radar to enhance object detection and localization.
   - **Vehicle State Estimation:** Uses vehicle dynamics and sensory data to estimate the vehicle's pose and velocity states.
   - **Environmental State Estimation:** Combines traffic and road condition data to create a driving context and model the dynamic environment.
   - **Hierarchical Planning and Control:** Facilitates route planning, behavioral planning, motion planning, and control actions, ensuring the vehicle makes safe and efficient driving decisions.
   - **Safety and Monitoring Systems:** Implements collision avoidance strategies and continuously monitors sensor and system health for safety compliance.

This model operates at multiple temporal scales, with high-frequency vehicle control and lower frequencies for perception, planning, and monitoring, ensuring real-time responsiveness to environmental changes while adhering to safety standards.
