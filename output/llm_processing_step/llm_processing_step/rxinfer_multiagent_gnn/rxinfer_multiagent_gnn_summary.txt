### Summary of the GNN Model: Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Model Name:** Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Purpose:**  
The model is designed for simulating trajectory planning in a multi-agent system within RxInfer.jl. It incorporates mechanisms for agents to navigate a 2D environment while avoiding obstacles, targeting goals, and preventing collisions with one another.

**Key Components:**

1. **State Space Model:**
   - **State Transition Matrix (A)**: Defines how agents transition between states over time.
   - **Control Input Matrix (B)**: Represents the influence of control inputs on the agents' movements.
   - **Observation Matrix (C)**: Maps the state space to observable outputs.

2. **Parameters:**
   - Time step (`dt`), number of steps (`nr_steps`), number of agents (`nr_agents`), and inference iterations (`nr_iterations`).
   - Variances for initial states, control inputs, goal constraints, and parameters for the GammaShapeRate prior.

3. **Agent Configurations:**
   - Each agent has specific identifiers, radii, initial positions, and target positions defined for effective trajectory planning.

4. **Environment Definitions:**
   - The model includes various obstacles (doors, walls, combined environments) with specified centers and sizes.

**Main Connections:**
- The state space model feeds into agent trajectories, which are influenced by initial state variance and control variance.
- Goal constraints are linked with agent trajectories to ensure agents aim for specific targets.
- Obstacle avoidance is established based on the proximity of agents to obstacles, while collision avoidance mechanisms are implemented to maintain safe distances between agents.
- All these components culminate in a comprehensive planning system that integrates goal-directed behavior, obstacle avoidance, and collision avoidance.

This model allows for the simulation of complex interactions in multi-agent systems, providing insights into trajectory planning under various constraints and environmental conditions.
