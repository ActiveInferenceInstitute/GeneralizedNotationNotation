### Summary of the GNN Model: RxInfer Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Model Name**: Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Purpose**: The model is designed for simulating trajectory planning for multiple agents in a 2D environment, incorporating key aspects such as obstacle avoidance, goal-directed behavior, and inter-agent collision avoidance.

**Key Components**:

1. **State Space Model**:
   - **Parameters**:
     - Time step (`dt`), constraint parameter (`gamma`), and number of time steps (`nr_steps`).
     - Number of agents (`nr_agents`) and inference iterations (`nr_iterations`).
   - **Matrices**:
     - **State Transition Matrix (A)**: Defines how agent states evolve over time.
     - **Control Input Matrix (B)**: Relates control inputs to state changes.
     - **Observation Matrix (C)**: Maps states to observations.
   - **Prior Distributions**: Include variances for initial states, control inputs, and goal constraints.

2. **Agent Configurations**:
   - Includes parameters for up to four agents, such as IDs, radii, initial positions, and target positions.

3. **Environment Definitions**:
   - Specifies various obstacles in the environment, including door and wall configurations, with their respective sizes and centers.

4. **Visualization Parameters**:
   - Details for plotting simulation results including boundaries, heatmap resolution, and visual properties of agents and targets.

**Main Connections**:
- The model connects various components to facilitate the trajectory planning system:
  - The state space model is linked to the computation of agent trajectories.
  - Trajectories are influenced by goal constraints and obstacle avoidance parameters, creating a holistic planning system that incorporates collision avoidance among agents.

**Dynamics**:
- The model operates in discrete time, simulating the agents' movements over a defined time horizon based on the specified number of steps.

This GNN model exemplifies a structured approach to planning and simulating interactions among multiple agents in complex environments, leveraging probabilistic methods to ensure effective pathfinding and obstacle navigation.
