### Summary of GNN Model: Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Model Name:** Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Purpose:**  
This model is designed for simulating multi-agent trajectory planning in a 2D environment using the RxInfer.jl framework. It incorporates mechanisms for obstacle avoidance, goal-directed behavior, and inter-agent collision avoidance.

**Key Components:**

1. **State Space Model:**
   - **States and Observations:**
     - **State Transition Matrix (A)**: Defines how agent states evolve over time.
     - **Control Input Matrix (B)**: Represents how control inputs affect agent states.
     - **Observation Matrix (C)**: Maps agent states to observable outputs.
   - **Parameters:**
     - Time step (`dt`), number of agents (`nr_agents`), and various variances for initial state, control inputs, and goal constraints.

2. **Agent Configurations:**
   - Each agent is characterized by an ID, radius, initial position, and target position (4 agents in total).

3. **Environment Definitions:**
   - Various obstacles are defined (door, wall, combined environments) with specified centers and sizes to ensure agents navigate around them.

4. **Experiment Configurations:**
   - Random seeds for reproducibility and file paths for saving results and visualizations.

**Main Connections:**
- The model connects various components to form a complete planning system:
  - The state space model feeds into agent trajectories.
  - Agent trajectories are processed to enforce goal constraints, obstacle avoidance, and collision avoidance.
  - The outcomes of these processes integrate into a comprehensive planning system, ensuring agents can navigate towards their targets while avoiding obstacles and each other.

This GNN model effectively encapsulates the dynamics and constraints necessary for simulating multi-agent behavior in complex environments, facilitating analysis and visualization of their trajectories.
