### Summary of the GNN Model: RxInfer Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Model Name:** Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Purpose:**  
This GNN model is designed for simulating trajectory planning in a multi-agent system within a 2D environment. It emphasizes obstacle avoidance, goal-directed behavior, and inter-agent collision avoidance.

**Key Components:**

1. **State Space Model:**
   - The model utilizes a state space representation to track the positions and movements of multiple agents over discrete time steps.
   - Key parameters include:
     - `dt`: Time step for updates
     - `A`: State transition matrix that governs the evolution of agent states
     - `B`: Control input matrix for agent controls
     - `C`: Observation matrix mapping states to observations

2. **Primary States/Observations:**
   - Agents are represented with state variables, including their positions and velocities.
   - Observations are derived from the state space model, allowing for the monitoring of agent positions relative to goals and obstacles.
   - Variances are defined for initial states, control inputs, and goal constraints to model uncertainty.

3. **Connections:**
   - **State Space Model Interactions:**
     - The state transition and control input matrices (`A`, `B`) feed into the state space model.
   - **Agent Trajectories:**
     - The model generates agent trajectories based on state space parameters and variances.
   - **Behavioral Constraints:**
     - Goal-directed behavior and obstacle avoidance are modeled using probabilistic constraints, incorporating distances to obstacles and inter-agent dynamics.
   - **Planning System:**
     - The final planning system integrates goal-directed behavior, obstacle avoidance, and collision avoidance to produce coherent trajectories for all agents.

In summary, the model serves as a framework for planning and simulating the movements of multiple agents in complex environments, ensuring that they reach their goals while avoiding obstacles and collisions with one another.
