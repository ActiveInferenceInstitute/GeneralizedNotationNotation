### Summary of GNN Model: RxInfer Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Model Name:** Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Purpose:**  
This model is designed for simulating multi-agent trajectory planning within a 2D environment using the RxInfer.jl framework. It incorporates considerations for obstacle avoidance, goal-directed behavior, and inter-agent collision avoidance, making it suitable for dynamic environments with various obstacles.

**Key Components:**

1. **State Space Model:**
   - **State Transition Matrix (A):** Defines how agents transition between states over discrete time steps.
   - **Control Input Matrix (B):** Models the influence of control inputs on the agents' states.
   - **Observation Matrix (C):** Maps the state variables to observable outputs.
   - **Parameters:** Includes time step (`dt`), variance for initial state and control inputs, and other constraints relevant to the agents' movements.

2. **Agent Configurations:**
   - Each agent has an ID, radius, initial position, and target position, allowing for individualized planning and pathfinding.

3. **Environment Definitions:**
   - Specifies multiple obstacles (e.g., doors and walls) with defined positions and sizes to challenge the agents' trajectories.

4. **Visualization Parameters:**
   - Parameters for plotting the trajectories, including plot dimensions, resolution, and color palettes to enhance the visualization of agent movements.

**Main Connections:**
- The state space model outputs are connected to the agent trajectories, which incorporate initial state variance and control variance.
- The resulting agent trajectories feed into subsystems for goal-directed behavior, obstacle avoidance, and collision avoidance.
- Ultimately, these components integrate into a complete planning system that coordinates the agents' movements in the presence of obstacles and goals.

This GNN framework provides a comprehensive setup for simulating and analyzing multi-agent interactions in trajectory planning scenarios.
