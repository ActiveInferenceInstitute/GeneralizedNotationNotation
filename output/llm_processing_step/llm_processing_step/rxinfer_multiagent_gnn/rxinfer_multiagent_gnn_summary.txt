### Summary of GNN Model: Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Model Name:** Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Purpose:**  
The model is designed for simulating trajectory planning for multiple agents in a 2D environment, emphasizing obstacle avoidance, goal-directed behavior, and inter-agent collision avoidance. It serves as a framework for analyzing how agents navigate complex spaces while adhering to various constraints.

**Key Components:**

1. **State Space Model:**
   - **Parameters:**
     - Time step (`dt`), constraint parameter (`gamma`), number of time steps (`nr_steps`), number of inference iterations (`nr_iterations`), and number of agents (`nr_agents`).
   - **Matrices:**
     - State transition matrix (`A`), control input matrix (`B`), and observation matrix (`C`).
   - **Distributions:**
     - Variances for initial state, control inputs, and goal constraints.

2. **Agent Configurations:**
   - Four agents with unique IDs, radii, initial positions, and target positions are defined.

3. **Environment Definitions:**
   - Obstacles are specified for various environments (door, wall, and combined) with defined centers and sizes.

4. **Visualization Parameters:**
   - Parameters for plotting and animation, including boundaries, frame rate, and color palette.

**Main Connections:**
- The model establishes connections between different components:
  - **State Space Model**: Links parameters (`dt`, `A`, `B`, `C`) to the overall state space.
  - **Agent Trajectories**: Connects state space outputs with initial variances and control variances to compute agent trajectories.
  - **Goal Constraints**: Integrates agent trajectories with goal constraint variances for goal-directed behavior.
  - **Obstacle Avoidance**: Connects agent trajectories with parameters to manage obstacle avoidance.
  - **Collision Avoidance**: Ensures agents do not collide by linking trajectories and their respective radii.
  - **Planning System**: Combines goal-directed behavior, obstacle avoidance, and collision avoidance into a unified planning framework.

This GNN model serves as an essential tool for simulating and analyzing multi-agent interactions in complex environments, providing insights into trajectory planning under various constraints.
