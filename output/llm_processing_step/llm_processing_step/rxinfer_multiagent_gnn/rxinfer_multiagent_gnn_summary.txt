### Summary of the GNN Model: Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Model Name:** Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Purpose:**  
The model is designed for simulating trajectory planning in a multi-agent scenario within a 2D environment, accommodating obstacles and ensuring goal-directed behavior as well as collision avoidance among agents.

**Key Components:**

1. **State Space Model:**
   - **Parameters:**
     - `dt`: Time step for state updates.
     - `gamma`: Constraint parameter for obstacle avoidance.
     - `nr_steps`: Number of time steps in the trajectory.
     - `nr_agents`: Total number of agents involved.
   - **Matrices:**
     - `A`: State transition matrix.
     - `B`: Control input matrix.
     - `C`: Observation matrix.
   - **Prior Distributions:**
     - Variances for initial states, control inputs, and goal constraints.

2. **Agent Configurations:**
   - Four agents are defined, each with unique IDs, radii, initial positions, and target positions.

3. **Environment Definitions:**
   - Different types of obstacles are defined, including door and wall environments, with specific centers and sizes.

4. **Visualization Parameters:**
   - Settings for plotting the environment and agent behaviors, including boundaries, resolution, and color palettes.

**Main Connections:**
- **State Space Model to Agent Trajectories:** The state space model informs the initial state variance and control variance for agent trajectories.
- **Goal Constraints:** Agent trajectories influence their goal-directed behavior, incorporating variances in goal constraints.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The model assesses agent trajectories against obstacles, incorporating the gamma parameter for avoidance.
- **Collision Avoidance:** Inter-agent trajectories are managed to prevent collisions based on their positions and radii.
- **Planning System:** Integrates goal-directed behavior, obstacle avoidance, and collision avoidance to create a cohesive trajectory planning framework.

This GNN model encapsulates a comprehensive approach to multi-agent navigation in environments with obstacles, focusing on achieving efficient planning and safety through modeled interactions and constraints.
