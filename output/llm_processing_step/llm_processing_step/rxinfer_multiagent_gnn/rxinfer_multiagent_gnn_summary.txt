### Summary of the GNN Model: Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Model Name:** Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Purpose:** The model is designed to simulate and optimize the trajectory planning of multiple agents within a 2D environment, while ensuring obstacle avoidance, goal-directed behavior, and inter-agent collision avoidance. It is implemented in the RxInfer.jl framework.

**Key Components:**

1. **State Space Model:**
   - **Parameters:**
     - Time step (`dt`)
     - Constraint parameter (`gamma`)
     - Number of time steps (`nr_steps`)
     - Number of agents (`nr_agents`)
     - Various variances for initial state, control inputs, and goal constraints.

   - **Matrices:**
     - State transition matrix (`A`)
     - Control input matrix (`B`)
     - Observation matrix (`C`)

2. **Agent Configuration:**
   - Four agents with individual properties such as ID, radius, initial position, and target position.

3. **Environment Definitions:**
   - Various obstacles defined by their centers and sizes, including door and wall obstacles, accommodating different scenarios.

4. **Visualization Parameters:**
   - Settings for plot boundaries, animation frames per second, heatmap resolution, and color palettes for visual output.

**Main Connections:**
- The state space model connects to agent trajectories, which are influenced by initial state variance and control variance.
- Goal-directed behavior is linked with agent trajectories and goal constraints.
- Obstacle and collision avoidance mechanisms derive from agent trajectories and involve parameters related to the agents and the environment.
- The complete planning system integrates goal-directed behavior, obstacle avoidance, and collision avoidance to generate optimal trajectories.

This GNN model provides a comprehensive framework for simulating and analyzing multi-agent interactions in dynamic environments, facilitating the study of trajectory planning with respect to various constraints and objectives.
