### Summary of the GNN Model: Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Model Name:**  
Multi-agent Trajectory Planning

**Purpose:**  
This GNN model is designed for simulating trajectory planning in a multi-agent context within the RxInfer.jl framework. It incorporates mechanisms for obstacle avoidance, goal-directed behavior, and inter-agent collision avoidance in a 2D environment.

**Key Components:**

1. **State Space Model:**
   - **Parameters:**
     - Time step (`dt`), constraint parameters (`gamma`), number of time steps (`nr_steps`), and number of agents (`nr_agents`).
   - **Matrices:**
     - State transition matrix (`A`), control input matrix (`B`), and observation matrix (`C`).
   - **Prior Distributions:**
     - Variances for initial states, control inputs, and goal constraints.

2. **Agent Configurations:**
   - Each agent has defined properties, including ID, radius, initial position, and target position for four agents.

3. **Environment Definitions:**
   - Various obstacles are defined, including door and wall obstacles, with specific positions and sizes.

**Main Connections:**
- The state space model parameters and matrices feed into the agent trajectories.
- The agent trajectories are influenced by goal constraints and variances, leading to goal-directed behavior.
- Obstacle avoidance and collision avoidance mechanisms are derived from the agent trajectories, ensuring agents navigate the environment without colliding with obstacles or each other.
- The complete planning system integrates these components to facilitate coordinated trajectory planning.

This model effectively provides a structured approach to multi-agent trajectory planning, ensuring agents can navigate complex environments while adhering to defined constraints.
