### Summary of the Active Inference Language Model (AILM)

**Model Name:**  
Active Inference Language Model (AILM) v0.1

**Purpose:**  
The AILM is designed as a comprehensive Active Inference agent aimed at understanding and generating language. It encapsulates various levels of linguistic processing, from phonetics to discourse, and serves as a blueprint for demonstrating the capabilities of a Generalized Notation Notation (GNN) framework in handling complex, multi-faceted models without relying on pre-existing training datasets.

**Key Components:**

1. **States:**
   - **Hidden State Factors:**
     - **Phonetic Level:** 
       - `s_f0`: Phonetic Target (10 categories)
       - `s_f1`: Articulatory Configuration (5 configurations)
     - **Lexical & Morpho-Syntactic Level:** 
       - `s_f2`: Active Lexical Concept ID (50 concepts)
       - `s_f3`: Current Syntactic Role (8 roles)
       - `s_f4`: Morpho-Syntactic Features (10 feature sets)
     - **Semantic Level:** 
       - `s_f5`: Semantic Proposition ID (100 propositions)
       - `s_f6`: Semantic Valence (5 valences)
     - **Context Level:** 
       - `s_f7`: Situational Context Key (10 keys)
       - `s_f8`: Narrative Focus ID (20 foci)
       - `s_f9`: Partner Model State (5 states)
     - **Goal & Prediction Level:** 
       - `s_f10`: Communicative Intent ID (10 intents)
       - `s_f11`: Predicted Next Lexical Concept ID (20 concepts)

2. **Observations:**
   - **Observation Modalities:**
     - `o_m0`: Auditory Stream Segment (20 categories)
     - `o_m1`: Semantic Coherence Signal (5 levels)
     - `o_m2`: Discourse Progress Signal (5 signals)
     - `o_m3`: Partner Feedback Cue (5 cues)

3. **Control Factors:**
   - **Policies and Actions:**
     - `pi_c0`: Vocalization Effort (5 actions)
     - `pi_c1`: Lexical Emphasis (20 actions)
     - `pi_c2`: Intent Refinement (10 actions)

**Main Connections:**
- **Priors to States:** Initial hidden states are informed by prior distributions across various factors.
- **State to Observation:** Hidden states influence the likelihood of observations through specific mappings (e.g., phonetic states to auditory stream observations).
- **State Transitions:** The model incorporates transition dynamics that dictate how states evolve over time based on actions taken (e.g., phonetic and syntactic transitions influenced by control factors).
- **Expected Free Energy (G):** The model evaluates the expected free energy based on preferences and likelihoods, guiding the selection of actions to achieve communicative intents.

Overall, the AILM serves as an ambitious conceptual framework for exploring the intricacies of language processing through an Active Inference lens, while also testing the GNN pipeline's capabilities.
