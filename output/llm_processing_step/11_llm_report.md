  ### 1. Summary
The GNN model presented is a **Standard POMDP Agent v1.0**, designed as a comprehensive representation of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Its key components include:
- **Hidden States**: Two factors representing the agent's location (3 states: RoomA, RoomB, Corridor) and resource level (2 states: Low, High).
- **Observations**: Two modalities capturing different cues from the environment: VisualCue (4 outcomes: Door, Window, Food, Empty) and AuditorySignal (2 outcomes: Silence, Beep).
- **Control Factors**: Two action types, Movement (3 actions: Stay, MoveClockwise, MoveCounterClockwise) and Interaction (2 actions: Wait, InteractWithResource).
This model serves as a basis for testing GNN features within the PyMDP framework.

### 2. General Explanation
This GNN model is structured to facilitate the representation and processing of decision-making tasks under uncertainty, characteristic of POMDPs. It captures the dynamics of an agent operating in an...

  ### Inferred Purpose/Domain

The GNN model delineated in the provided specification is designed to represent a **comprehensive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) agent** that operates in environments where the agent must make decisions based on incomplete information about its state. This is evident from the model's structure, which incorporates hidden state factors such as **Location** and **ResourceLevel**, both of which are critical for determining the agent's behavior in an uncertain environment. The model includes two observation modalities, **VisualCue** and **AuditorySignal**, indicating that the agent relies on multiple sensory inputs to infer its surroundings and make decisions.

The presence of control factors (actions) like **Movement** and **Interaction** further reinforces the model's purpose as a decision-making agent capable of navigating and interacting with its environment. Specifically, the actions include movement options (e.g., stay, move clockwise...

  ### 1. Explain Mappings

The **ActInfOntologyAnnotation** block in the GNN file provides mappings of model components to terms used within the Active Inference framework. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of these mappings:

- **Hidden States:**
  - `s_f0=HiddenStateFactor0`
  - `s_f1=HiddenStateFactor1`
  
  These mappings indicate that the hidden states of the model, which represent unobserved factors affecting decision-making (like the agent's location and resource level), correspond to the ontology's concept of hidden state factors. In Active Inference, hidden states represent the agent's beliefs about the world that are not directly observable.

- **Observations:**
  - `o_m0=ObservationModality0`
  - `o_m1=ObservationModality1`
  
  This mapping denotes that the observation modalities, which are the sensory inputs that the agent receives (like visual and auditory cues), relate to the observation terms in the ontology. Observations are critical in Active Inference as they provide the evidence fro...

  ### 1. Summary
The model presented is titled **"Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1"** and is structured in the Generalized Notation Notation (GNN) format to represent a multifactor PyMDP agent. Key components include:
- **States:** The model comprises two hidden state factors: "reward_level" (with 2 states) and "decision_state" (with 3 states).
- **Observations:** The agent has three observation modalities: "state_observation" (3 outcomes), "reward" (3 outcomes), and "decision_proprioceptive" (3 outcomes).
- **Connections:** The model defines relationships between states, observations, and actions, facilitating dynamic interactions among these components.

### 2. General Explanation
The **Multifactor PyMDP Agent** is designed to model decision-making processes in environments with multiple sources of information. It utilizes a framework known as Active Inference, where the agent infers its internal states based on observations and optimizes its actions to minimize expected free energy.

  ### Inferred Purpose/Domain

The GNN model detailed in the document represents a **Multifactor PyMDP Agent** designed for **Active Inference** in a decision-making context, likely applicable to areas such as reinforcement learning, cognitive science, and robotics. The model's structure involves multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors, indicating a sophisticated approach to modeling agents that learn from diverse sensory inputs and make decisions based on internal states.

Key features that support this inference include:
- **Observation Modalities**: The model incorporates three distinct observation modalities: "state_observation", "reward", and "decision_proprioceptive", each with three possible outcomes. This suggests a system capable of processing various types of information, reflecting the complexities of real-world environments where an agent must assess both its surroundings and internal states.
- **Hidden State Factors**: The model defines two hidden state fact...

  ### 1. Explain Mappings

The **ActInfOntologyAnnotation** block in the GNN file provides mappings from the model components to terms used in the Active Inference ontology, which helps to define and standardize the understanding of elements in the model. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of these mappings:

- **A_m0, A_m1, A_m2**: These are the likelihood matrices for each observation modality. Each matrix represents how likely different observations are given the hidden states. In the ontology, they are referred to as:
  - **LikelihoodMatrixModality0** for A_m0
  - **LikelihoodMatrixModality1** for A_m1
  - **LikelihoodMatrixModality2** for A_m2
  This mapping signifies that these matrices are used to compute the likelihood of observations given the hidden states in the Active Inference framework.

- **B_f0, B_f1**: These are transition matrices for the hidden state factors. They define how the hidden states evolve over time based on actions. In the ontology, they are:
  - **TransitionMatrixFactor0**...
