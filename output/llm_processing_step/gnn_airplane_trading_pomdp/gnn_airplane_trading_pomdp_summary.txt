### Summary of GNN Model: Airplane Trading POMDP

**ModelName**: Airplane Trading POMDP v1.0

**Purpose**: This model represents a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) for an agent managing an investment portfolio aboard an airplane. The unique challenge of this scenario is the direct impact of financial losses from trading on the airplane's fuel reserves.

**Key Components**:

1. **Hidden States**:
   - `NivelCombustible` (Fuel Level): 
     - States: {Crítico, Bajo, Medio, Alto} (4 states)
   - `RendimientoMercado` (Market Performance): 
     - States: {Pérdidas, Neutral, Rentable} (3 states)

2. **Observations**:
   - `IndicadorCombustible` (Fuel Gauge): 
     - Outcomes: {CasiVacío, Mitad, Lleno} (3 outcomes)
   - `ResultadoOperacion` (Trading Outcome): 
     - Outcomes: {Pérdida, SinCambio, Ganancia} (3 outcomes)

3. **Control Factor (Action)**:
   - `EstrategiaInversion` (Investment Strategy): 
     - Actions: {Desinvertir, Mantener, Invertir} (3 actions)

**Main Connections**:
- **Priors to Initial States**: The model connects prior distributions over hidden states (`D_f0`, `D_f1`) to the initial hidden states (`s_f0`, `s_f1`).
- **States to Observations**: The hidden states influence the likelihood of observations through likelihood mappings (`A_m0`, `A_m1`).
- **States and Actions to Transitions**: The hidden states and chosen actions define the transition dynamics to the next states (`B_f0`, `B_f1`).
- **Preferences and Expected Free Energy**: Preferences over outcomes contribute to the calculation of Expected Free Energy (`G`), which in turn influences policy decisions (`pi_c0`), leading to chosen actions (`u_c0`).

This model encapsulates the complex interactions between trading decisions, fuel management, and market performance, providing a framework for decision-making under uncertainty in a unique operational environment.
