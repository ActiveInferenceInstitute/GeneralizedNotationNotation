### Summary of the GNN Model: Airplane Trading POMDP

**Model Name**: Airplane Trading POMDP v1.0

**Purpose**: This model represents a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) for an agent managing an investment portfolio aboard an airplane. The critical challenge addressed is the impact of financial trading losses on the airplane's fuel reserves.

#### Key Components:

1. **Hidden States**:
   - **Fuel Level (`NivelCombustible`)**: Four discrete states - {Crítico, Bajo, Medio, Alto}.
   - **Market Performance (`RendimientoMercado`)**: Three discrete states - {Pérdidas, Neutral, Rentable}.

2. **Observations**:
   - **Fuel Gauge (`IndicadorCombustible`)**: Three outcomes - {CasiVacío, Mitad, Lleno}.
   - **Trading Outcome (`ResultadoOperacion`)**: Three outcomes - {Pérdida, SinCambio, Ganancia}.

3. **Control Factor (Action)**:
   - **Investment Strategy (`EstrategiaInversion`)**: Three actions - {Desinvertir, Mantener, Invertir}.

#### Main Connections:

- **Priors to Initial States**: Initial distributions (`D_f0`, `D_f1`) inform the hidden states (`s_f0`, `s_f1`).
- **States to Observations**: The hidden states influence the likelihood of observations through likelihood mappings (`A_m0`, `A_m1`).
- **State Transitions**: The relationships between states and actions determine the transition dynamics (`B_f0`, `B_f1`) for the next state given current states and chosen actions.
- **Expected Free Energy**: Preferences over outcomes and predicted states contribute to the overall expected free energy (`G`), which influences the choice of policies (`pi_c0`) and, subsequently, the chosen actions (`u_c0`).

This model encapsulates the interplay between financial decision-making and operational constraints in an airborne context, providing a structured approach to managing risk associated with trading in dynamic environments.
