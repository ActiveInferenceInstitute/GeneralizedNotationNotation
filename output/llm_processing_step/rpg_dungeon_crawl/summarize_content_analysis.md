### Model Overview
The "Collaborative Role Playing Game with Active Inference Agents" model represents a multi-agent role-playing game (RPG) environment, designed to facilitate collaborative gameplay among players with distinct character roles (Fighter, Mage, Rogue, Cleric) and a Dungeon Master (DM) who dynamically controls the narrative and environment. This model incorporates active inference principles to enable agents to adapt their strategies based on environmental changes, player interactions, and narrative developments, fostering emergent storytelling and character development.

### Key Variables
- **Hidden States**:
  - **fighter_health**: Current hit points of the Fighter.
  - **mage_mana**: Available spellcasting resource for the Mage.
  - **rogue_stealth**: Current level of stealth for the Rogue.
  - **cleric_divine_power**: Healing and divine magic resource for the Cleric.
  - **dm_narrative_state**: Progression of the current story arc controlled by the DM.
  - **dungeon_layout**: 2D grid representing the state of the dungeon environment.

- **Observations**:
  - **visual_fighter**: Visual information available to the Fighter.
  - **audio_all**: Sounds audible to all players.
  - **tactical_health**: Health states of all party members.
  - **social_dm_descriptions**: Narrative descriptions provided by the DM.
  - **magical_auras**: Magical effects detectable by the Mage and Cleric.

- **Actions/Controls**:
  - **fighter_combat**: Combat actions available to the Fighter.
  - **mage_spells**: Spellcasting options for the Mage.
  - **rogue_exploration**: Actions related to exploration and stealth for the Rogue.
  - **cleric_healing**: Healing actions available to the Cleric.
  - **dm_environmental**: Actions for the DM to control environmental changes.

### Critical Parameters
- **Most Important Matrices**:
  - **A Matrix**: Represents the dynamics of character states and their interactions with actions.
  - **B Matrix**: Captures the influence of hidden states on observations.
  - **C Matrix**: Relates actions to expected outcomes and observations.
  - **D Matrix**: Connects environmental controls to narrative and gameplay dynamics.

- **Key Hyperparameters**:
  - **num_players**: 4 (number of player characters).
  - **num_dm_agents**: 1 (number of Dungeon Masters).
  - **dungeon_size**: [100, 100] (dimensions of the dungeon).
  - **planning_depth**: 5 (depth of planning for actions).
  - **collaboration_enabled**: true (indicates collaborative gameplay features).

### Notable Features
- The model supports **dynamic and adaptive gameplay**, allowing for real-time adjustments based on player actions and DM decisions.
- **Emergent narrative generation** is facilitated through interactions between characters and the environment, creating unique storytelling experiences.
- **Hierarchical goal structures** enable characters to pursue immediate survival, quest objectives, and character development simultaneously.
- The model incorporates **multi-modal observations** (visual, auditory, tactical, social, magical), enhancing the richness of gameplay.

### Use Cases
This model is applicable in scenarios such as:
- **Tabletop RPG simulations** where players engage in collaborative storytelling and strategic gameplay.
- **AI-driven narrative generation** for interactive storytelling applications.
- **Game design and testing** for developing adaptive AI agents in complex environments.
- **Educational tools** for teaching game mechanics and collaborative decision-making in a controlled setting.
