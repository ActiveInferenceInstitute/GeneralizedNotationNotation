### Model Overview
The **Deep Generative Model for Policy Selection with Meta-Awareness** is a computational architecture designed to model meta-awareness and attentional control through deep parametric active inference. It integrates hierarchical inference for policy selection over cognitive states, allowing for dynamic perception and action within a unified framework, thereby capturing the opacity-transparency dynamics characteristic of conscious experience.

### Key Variables
- **Hidden States**:
  - `s`: Current beliefs about hidden states (2-dimensional continuous).
  - `s_prev`: Beliefs about hidden states at the previous time step.
  - `s_next`: Beliefs about hidden states at the next time step.
  - `s_bar`: Posterior beliefs about hidden states after inference.

- **Observations**:
  - `o`: Current discrete observations (2-dimensional).
  - `o_bar`: Posterior beliefs about observations.
  - `o_pred`: Predicted observations based on current beliefs.

- **Actions/Controls**:
  - `π`: Policy beliefs representing the posterior over possible policies.
  - `π_bar`: Updated posterior beliefs about policies.
  - `u`: Selected action based on policy selection.

### Critical Parameters
- **Matrices**:
  - **A (Likelihood Matrix)**: Maps hidden states to observations \( P(o|s) \), indicating the likelihood of observations given hidden states.
  - **B (Transition Matrix)**: Represents state dynamics \( P(s'|s, \pi) \) under baseline conditions, capturing the tendency to remain in current states.
  - **B_pi (Policy-Dependent Transition Matrices)**: Defines how state transitions vary with different policies.
  - **C (Prior Preferences)**: Represents prior preferences over observations, influencing the expected outcomes.
  - **D (Prior State Beliefs)**: Prior beliefs about initial hidden states, allowing for uncertainty in starting conditions.

- **Key Hyperparameters**:
  - `γ_A`: Precision of the likelihood mapping, set to 2.0 for moderate confidence.
  - `β_A`: Inverse precision, calculated as \( 1/γ_A \), set to 0.5.

### Notable Features
- The model employs **precision control** to modulate attention, allowing for adaptive responses to uncertainty in observations.
- It incorporates **meta-awareness states** that influence confidence in lower-level mappings, enhancing cognitive control.
- The architecture supports **dynamic temporal dependencies** across past, present, and future states, enabling a comprehensive understanding of cognitive processes.

### Use Cases
This model is applicable in scenarios involving cognitive control, such as:
- Understanding decision-making processes in uncertain environments.
- Investigating the dynamics of attention and awareness in cognitive neuroscience.
- Developing interventions for attentional disorders by modeling how meta-awareness influences cognitive states and actions.
