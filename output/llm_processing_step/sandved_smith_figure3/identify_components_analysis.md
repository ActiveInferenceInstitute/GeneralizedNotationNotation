The provided GNN specification outlines a Deep Generative Model for Policy Selection with a focus on meta-awareness and attentional control. Below is a systematic breakdown of the components in the GNN specification, categorized as requested.

### 1. State Variables (Hidden States)
- **Variable Names and Dimensions**:
  - `s[2,1,type=continuous]`: Current hidden state beliefs.
  - `s_prev[2,1,type=continuous]`: Hidden state beliefs at the previous time step.
  - `s_next[2,1,type=continuous]`: Hidden state beliefs at the next time step.
  - `s_bar[2,1,type=continuous]`: Posterior hidden state beliefs.

- **Conceptual Representation**:
  - `s`: Represents the current beliefs about the hidden states based on observations and actions.
  - `s_prev`: Reflects the beliefs about the hidden states from the previous time step, allowing for temporal continuity.
  - `s_next`: Projects beliefs about hidden states into the next time step, essential for dynamic modeling.
  - `s_bar`: Represents the updated beliefs about hidden states after incorporating new observations.

- **State Space Structure**:
  - The state space is continuous and finite, with 2 hidden states, which may represent different cognitive or perceptual states relevant to the model.

### 2. Observation Variables
- **Observation Modalities and Meanings**:
  - `o[2,1,type=discrete]`: Current observations, which are discrete outcomes based on the hidden states.
  - `o_bar[2,1,type=continuous]`: Posterior beliefs about observations, reflecting updated information after processing.
  - `o_pred[2,1,type=continuous]`: Predicted observations based on current beliefs and model dynamics.

- **Sensor/Measurement Interpretations**:
  - Observations are derived from the hidden states through the likelihood mapping, indicating how well the hidden states explain the observed data.

- **Noise Models or Uncertainty Characterization**:
  - The likelihood matrix `A` captures the noise in the observation process, where the probabilities indicate the confidence in the mapping from hidden states to observations.

### 3. Action/Control Variables
- **Available Actions and Their Effects**:
  - `u[1,type=int]`: Selected action, which can influence the transition dynamics and the subsequent hidden states.

- **Control Policies and Decision Variables**:
  - `π[2,type=continuous]`: Policy beliefs, representing the agent's beliefs about the effectiveness of different policies.
  - `π_bar[2,type=continuous]`: Updated policy posterior, reflecting the agent's revised beliefs after processing information.

- **Action Space Properties**:
  - The action space is discrete, with a focus on selecting policies that guide the agent's behavior in the environment.

### 4. Model Matrices
- **A Matrices: Observation Models P(o|s)**:
  - `A[2,2,type=float]`: Likelihood mapping from hidden states to observations, indicating the probability of observing each outcome given the hidden states.

- **B Matrices: Transition Dynamics P(s'|s,π)**:
  - `B[2,2,1,type=float]`: Transition dynamics for the hidden states conditioned on the current state and selected policy.
  - `B_pi[2,2,2,type=float]`: Policy-dependent transition matrices that define how the hidden states evolve under different policies.

- **C Matrices: Preferences/Goals**:
  - `C[2,type=float]`: Prior preferences over observations, indicating the agent's goals or desired outcomes.

- **D Matrices: Prior Beliefs Over Initial States**:
  - `D[2,type=float]`: Prior beliefs about the initial states, reflecting the agent's uncertainty at the start of the process.

### 5. Parameters and Hyperparameters
- **Precision Parameters**:
  - `γ_A[1,type=float]`: Precision of the likelihood mapping, indicating the confidence in the observation model.
  - `β_A[1,type=float]`: Inverse precision parameter, related to the uncertainty in the likelihood mapping.
  - `β_A_bar[1,type=float]`: Updated inverse precision, reflecting changes in the confidence after learning.

- **Learning Rates and Adaptation Parameters**:
  - The specification does not explicitly define learning rates, but the precision parameters can be interpreted as controlling the learning dynamics.

- **Fixed vs. Learnable Parameters**:
  - The likelihood matrix `A`, transition matrices `B`, and prior matrices `C`, `D`, and `E` are fixed parameters initialized at the start, while hidden states and policy beliefs are learnable.

### 6. Temporal Structure
- **Time Horizons and Temporal Dependencies**:
  - The model operates over an unbounded time horizon, with a temporal depth of 3, indicating that it considers past, present, and future dependencies in state and observation dynamics.

- **Dynamic vs. Static Components**:
  - The model is dynamic, as it updates beliefs about hidden states and policies over time based on observations and actions. The temporal structure allows for continuous adaptation to new information, reflecting the active inference framework.

This structured breakdown provides a comprehensive understanding of the components in the GNN specification, highlighting their roles within the context of Active Inference and the overarching goals of the model.
