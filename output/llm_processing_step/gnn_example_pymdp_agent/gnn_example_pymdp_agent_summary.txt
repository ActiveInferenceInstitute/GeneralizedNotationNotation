### Summary of the GNN Model: Multifactor PyMDP Agent

**Model Name:** Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Purpose:** 
This model represents a PyMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) agent designed for active inference, utilizing multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors to make decisions based on uncertain environments.

**Key Components:**

1. **Observation Modalities:**
   - **State Observation:** 3 outcomes
   - **Reward:** 3 outcomes
   - **Decision Proprioceptive:** 3 outcomes

2. **Hidden State Factors:**
   - **Reward Level:** 2 states (uncontrollable)
   - **Decision State:** 3 states (controllable with 3 possible actions)

3. **Control Mechanism:**
   - The decision state factor is controllable, allowing the agent to select actions based on the policy.

**Main Connections:**
- The hidden states (s_f0 for reward level and s_f1 for decision state) are connected to the likelihood matrices (A_m0, A_m1, A_m2) which determine the probabilities of observations based on these states.
- The transitions between hidden states are governed by the transition matrices (B_f0, B_f1), where B_f1 is influenced by the agent's actions (u_f1).
- Observations (o_m0, o_m1, o_m2) provide data that is processed to update beliefs about the hidden states through the likelihood matrices.
- Expected Free Energy (G) is computed from the preferences (C_m0, C_m1, C_m2) and influences the policy (Ï€_f1), guiding the agent's actions.

This model utilizes standard PyMDP equations for state inference, policy inference, and action sampling, functioning in a discrete time dynamic system with an unbounded time horizon.
