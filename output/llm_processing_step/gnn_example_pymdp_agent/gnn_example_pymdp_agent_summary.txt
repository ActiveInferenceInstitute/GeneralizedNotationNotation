### Summary of the GNN Model: Multifactor PyMDP Agent

**Model Name:** Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Purpose:** 
The model represents a PyMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) agent designed for active inference, incorporating multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors. It aims to facilitate decision-making through a structured representation of state inference, policy inference, and action sampling.

**Key Components:**

1. **Observation Modalities:**
   - **State Observation:** 3 outcomes
   - **Reward:** 3 outcomes
   - **Decision Proprioceptive:** 3 outcomes

2. **Hidden State Factors:**
   - **Reward Level:** 2 states
   - **Decision State:** 3 states

3. **Control:**
   - The "decision_state" factor is controllable, allowing for 3 possible actions.

**Main Connections:**
- Hidden states (s_f0 and s_f1) are connected to the likelihood matrices (A_m0, A_m1, A_m2) representing observations.
- The transitions of hidden states (B_f0 and B_f1) are influenced by the actions taken (u_f1) and affect the future hidden states (s_prime_f0 and s_prime_f1).
- Preferences (C_m0, C_m1, C_m2) contribute to the calculation of Expected Free Energy (G), which in turn influences the policy distribution (Ï€_f1) and the chosen action (u_f1).
- The model operates in a discrete time setting with an unbounded time horizon, making it suitable for dynamic decision-making scenarios.

Overall, the Multifactor PyMDP Agent integrates various components for effective state and action inference, enabling robust decision-making in complex environments.
