### Summary of the GNN Model: Multifactor PyMDP Agent

**Model Name:** Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Purpose:** This model represents a PyMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) agent that incorporates multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors, designed for applications in active inference.

**Key Components:**
1. **Observation Modalities:**
   - **State Observation:** 3 outcomes
   - **Reward:** 3 outcomes
   - **Decision Proprioceptive:** 3 outcomes

2. **Hidden State Factors:**
   - **Reward Level:** 2 states
   - **Decision State:** 3 states
   - The decision state factor is controllable with 3 possible actions.

3. **State Space Matrices:**
   - **A_m matrices** represent the likelihood of observations given the hidden states (3 modalities).
   - **B_f matrices** define transitions between hidden states based on actions (2 factors).
   - **C vectors** indicate preferences for each modality (3 preferences per modality).
   - **D vectors** provide priors over hidden states (uniform distribution for both factors).

4. **Hidden States:**
   - **s_f0:** Hidden state for reward level (2 states)
   - **s_f1:** Hidden state for decision state (3 states)

5. **Observations:**
   - **o_m0, o_m1, o_m2:** Observations corresponding to each modality (3 outcomes each).

6. **Policy and Control:**
   - **π_f1:** Policy distribution over actions for the controllable factor.
   - **u_f1:** Action taken for the controllable factor.
   - **G:** Represents the expected free energy of the system.

**Main Connections:**
- The model defines a series of connections that link hidden states, observations, and actions:
  - Hidden state factors (D_f0, D_f1) connect to the state space matrices (A_m0, A_m1, A_m2).
  - Observations (o_m0, o_m1, o_m2) are derived from the state space matrices.
  - The control action (u_f1) primarily influences the transitions of the decision state (B_f1).
  - The expected free energy (G) is influenced by the preference vectors (C_m0, C_m1, C_m2) and defines the policy (π_f1).

This multifactor PyMDP agent serves as a flexible framework for modeling decision-making processes under uncertainty, leveraging multiple inputs and states for informed action selection.
