### Summary of GNN Model: Multifactor PyMDP Agent

**Model Name:** Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Purpose:** This model represents a PyMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) agent designed to handle multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors. It is structured to facilitate active inference, enabling the agent to make decisions based on diverse inputs and internal states.

**Key Components:**

1. **Observation Modalities:**
   - **State Observation:** 3 outcomes
   - **Reward:** 3 outcomes
   - **Decision Proprioceptive:** 3 outcomes

2. **Hidden State Factors:**
   - **Reward Level:** 2 states
   - **Decision State:** 3 states

3. **Control Factor:**
   - The **decision_state** factor is controllable with 3 possible actions.

**Main Connections:**
- The model connects hidden states (D_f0, D_f1) to their respective observations (A_m0, A_m1, A_m2).
- Observations are linked to their modalities (o_m0, o_m1, o_m2).
- The hidden states influence the transition dynamics (B_f0, B_f1) leading to the next hidden states (s_prime_f0, s_prime_f1).
- Preferences for observations (C_m0, C_m1, C_m2) contribute to the calculation of expected free energy (G), which in turn informs the policy (Ï€_f1) and the chosen action (u_f1).

Overall, the model integrates these components to enable the agent to infer states, derive policies, and sample actions based on the interplay of observations and hidden states, functioning over an unbounded time horizon in a discrete time framework.
