### Summary of the GNN Model: Multifactor PyMDP Agent

**Model Name:** Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1  
**Purpose:** This model represents a PyMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) agent designed to handle multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors, facilitating active inference processes.

#### Key Components:
- **Observation Modalities:**
  - **State Observation:** 3 possible outcomes.
  - **Reward:** 3 possible outcomes.
  - **Decision Proprioceptive:** 3 possible outcomes.

- **Hidden State Factors:**
  - **Reward Level:** 2 states (controlled).
  - **Decision State:** 3 states (controllable with 3 possible actions).

#### Main Connections:
1. **State Connections:**
   - The hidden states for reward level and decision state influence the likelihood matrices (A_m0, A_m1, A_m2) for the observation modalities.
   
2. **Observation to State Mapping:**
   - Observations from the modalities are generated based on the state factors, linking the hidden states to the observable outcomes.

3. **Control Mechanism:**
   - The decision state factor is influenced by an action (u_f1), which is derived from the policy distribution (Ï€_f1) that optimizes expected free energy (G).

4. **State Transition Dynamics:**
   - The transition matrices (B_f0 and B_f1) define how the hidden states evolve over time based on current states and actions taken.

5. **Expected Free Energy:**
   - The model computes expected free energy (G) using preferences defined in the C vectors for each modality, which informs decision-making processes.

This multifactor PyMDP agent model is structured for dynamic inference and decision-making in uncertain environments, making it suitable for applications in fields that require adaptive control and learning from observations.
