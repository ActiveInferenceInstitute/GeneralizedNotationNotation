### Summary of GNN Model: Multifactor PyMDP Agent

**Model Name:** Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Purpose:**  
The model represents a PyMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) agent designed for active inference with multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors. Its aim is to infer states, formulate policies, and sample actions based on observations and hidden states.

**Key Components:**

1. **Observation Modalities:**
   - **State Observation (o_m0):** 3 outcomes
   - **Reward (o_m1):** 3 outcomes
   - **Decision Proprioceptive (o_m2):** 3 outcomes

2. **Hidden State Factors:**
   - **Reward Level (s_f0):** 2 states
   - **Decision State (s_f1):** 3 states

3. **Control Mechanism:**
   - The **decision_state** factor is controllable with 3 possible actions (u_f1), influencing transitions in the model.

4. **State Transition and Likelihood Matrices:**
   - **A_matrices:** Likelihood matrices for each observation modality.
   - **B_matrices:** Transition matrices for the hidden state factors.
   - **C_vectors:** Preference vectors for each modality.
   - **D_vectors:** Priors over the hidden states.

**Main Connections:**
- The model structure connects priors (D_f0, D_f1) to hidden states (s_f0, s_f1), which in turn connect to the likelihood matrices (A_m0, A_m1, A_m2) and observations (o_m0, o_m1, o_m2).
- The hidden states influence the transition dynamics represented in the B_matrices, with the action taken (u_f1) primarily affecting the **decision_state** transitions (B_f1).
- The expected free energy (G) is computed from the preferences (C_m0, C_m1, C_m2) and subsequently influences the policy vector (Ï€_f1).

Overall, this GNN model encapsulates a multifactor agent capable of processing various observations and making decisions based on inferred hidden states within a structured active inference framework.
