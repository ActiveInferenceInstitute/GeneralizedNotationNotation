### Summary of the GNN Model: Multifactor PyMDP Agent

**Model Name:** Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Purpose:**  
The model represents a PyMDP agent designed for active inference, incorporating multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors. It aims to facilitate decision-making processes by integrating various forms of observations and controlling hidden state dynamics.

**Key Components:**

1. **Observation Modalities:**
   - **State Observation:** 3 possible outcomes.
   - **Reward:** 3 possible outcomes.
   - **Decision Proprioceptive:** 3 possible outcomes.

2. **Hidden State Factors:**
   - **Reward Level:** 2 states (e.g., low/high reward).
   - **Decision State:** 3 states (e.g., decision-making scenarios).

3. **Control Mechanism:**
   - The decision state factor is controllable with 3 possible actions, impacting the dynamics of the agent's decision-making process.

**Main Connections:**
- The model interrelates various components through specific connections:
  - The priors (D_f0, D_f1) influence the hidden states (s_f0, s_f1).
  - Hidden states affect the likelihood matrices (A_m0, A_m1, A_m2) for different modalities.
  - Observations (o_m0, o_m1, o_m2) emerge from the likelihood matrices.
  - Actions taken (u_f1) influence transitions for the decision state (B_f1) while the reward level transitions (B_f0) remain uncontrolled.
  - The model computes expected free energy (G) from the preferences (C_m0, C_m1, C_m2) and informs the policy distribution over actions (Ï€_f1).

Overall, this model encapsulates the dynamics of a multifactor PyMDP agent, aiming to leverage observations and control mechanisms for effective decision-making in uncertain environments.
