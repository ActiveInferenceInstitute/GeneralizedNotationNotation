### Summary of the GNN Model: Multifactor PyMDP Agent

**Model Name:** Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Purpose:**  
This model represents a PyMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) agent designed for active inference with multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors. It aims to facilitate decision-making processes by integrating observations and hidden states to optimize actions based on expected free energy.

**Key Components:**

1. **Observation Modalities:**
   - **State Observation:** 3 outcomes
   - **Reward:** 3 outcomes
   - **Decision Proprioceptive:** 3 outcomes

2. **Hidden State Factors:**
   - **Reward Level:** 2 states
   - **Decision State:** 3 states

3. **Control:**
   - The **decision_state** factor is controllable with 3 possible actions.

**Main Connections:**
- The model connects hidden states (`s_f0`, `s_f1`) to likelihood matrices (`A_m0`, `A_m1`, `A_m2`), which in turn connect to the observations (`o_m0`, `o_m1`, `o_m2`).
- The hidden states and the action taken (`u_f1`) influence the transition matrices (`B_f0`, `B_f1`), which determine the next hidden states (`s_prime_f0`, `s_prime_f1`).
- Preferences for observations (`C_m0`, `C_m1`, `C_m2`) contribute to the computation of the expected free energy (`G`), which is used to infer policies (`Ï€_f1`) and actions.

This model is structured to enable the agent to infer states, determine optimal policies, and sample actions dynamically, reflecting its adaptability and decision-making capabilities in uncertain environments.
