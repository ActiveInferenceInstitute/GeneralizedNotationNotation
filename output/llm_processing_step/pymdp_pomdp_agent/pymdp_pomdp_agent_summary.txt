### Summary of the GNN Model: Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Model Name:** Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Purpose:** This model represents a multifactor PyMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) agent designed for active inference, incorporating multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors. It aims to facilitate decision-making and state inference in dynamic environments.

**Key Components:**

1. **Observation Modalities:**
   - **State Observation:** 3 outcomes
   - **Reward:** 3 outcomes
   - **Decision Proprioceptive:** 3 outcomes

2. **Hidden State Factors:**
   - **Reward Level:** 2 states
   - **Decision State:** 3 states (controllable with 3 possible actions)

3. **State and Transition Matrices:**
   - **Likelihood Matrices (A_m):** Define the relationship between observations and hidden states for each modality.
     - A_m0, A_m1, A_m2 represent the likelihoods for each observation modality respectively.
   - **Transition Matrices (B_f):** Describe the state transitions for hidden states.
     - B_f0 for the reward level (uncontrolled).
     - B_f1 for the decision state (controlled with actions).

4. **Preference and Prior Vectors:**
   - **Preference Vectors (C_m):** Indicate the preferences for each observation modality.
   - **Prior Vectors (D_f):** Define the initial assumptions about the hidden states.

5. **Hidden States:**
   - **s_f0:** Hidden state for the reward level.
   - **s_f1:** Hidden state for the decision state.
   - **Next Hidden States:** s_prime_f0, s_prime_f1 represent the next states in the process.

6. **Policy and Control:**
   - Policy vector (π_f1) for decision-making, which is influenced by the expected free energy (G) and the chosen action (u_f1).

**Main Connections:**
- Hidden states (s_f0, s_f1) are connected to their respective likelihood matrices (A_m).
- The likelihood matrices lead to observations (o_m).
- The control action (u_f1) influences the transition matrix B_f1, while B_f0 remains unaffected.
- The expected free energy (G) is derived from the preference vectors and influences the policy vector (π_f1).

This model is structured to dynamically infer states, policies, and actions over an unbounded time horizon, reflecting a sophisticated approach to decision-making in environments with partial observability.
