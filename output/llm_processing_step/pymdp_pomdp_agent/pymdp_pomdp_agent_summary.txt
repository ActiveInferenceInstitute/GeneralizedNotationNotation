### Summary of the GNN Model: Multifactor PyMDP Agent

**Model Name:** Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Purpose:** This model represents a PyMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) agent that utilizes multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors to facilitate decision-making through active inference. It is designed to capture complex interactions between observations, hidden states, and actions, making it suitable for scenarios where agents must infer their states based on varied inputs.

**Key Components:**
1. **Observation Modalities:**
   - **State Observation:** 3 outcomes
   - **Reward:** 3 outcomes
   - **Decision Proprioceptive:** 3 outcomes

2. **Hidden State Factors:**
   - **Reward Level:** 2 states
   - **Decision State:** 3 states

3. **Control Mechanism:**
   - The **decision_state** factor is controllable with 3 possible actions.

**Main Connections:**
- **Hidden States to Observations:** The model connects hidden states (s_f0 and s_f1) to the likelihood matrices (A_m0, A_m1, A_m2) that determine the observations.
- **Actions and State Transitions:** The action taken (u_f1) influences the state transitions (B_f1) specifically for the controllable factor, while another factor (B_f0) remains uncontrolled.
- **Free Energy and Policy:** The expected free energy (G) is influenced by the preferences (C_m0, C_m1, C_m2) for each modality and directly impacts the policy distribution (Ï€_f1) for the controllable factor.

Overall, this GNN model integrates observations from different modalities, manages transitions between hidden states, and utilizes a policy for decision-making, making it a robust framework for active inference in complex environments.
