### Summary of the Multifactor PyMDP Agent GNN Model

**Model Name:** Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Purpose:** This model represents a Generalized Notation Notation (GNN) framework for a PyMDP agent that integrates multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors to facilitate decision-making in an Active Inference paradigm.

**Key Components:**
1. **Observation Modalities:**
   - **State Observation:** 3 outcomes
   - **Reward:** 3 outcomes
   - **Decision Proprioceptive:** 3 outcomes

2. **Hidden State Factors:**
   - **Reward Level:** 2 states
   - **Decision State:** 3 states

3. **Control:**
   - The **decision_state** factor is controllable with 3 possible actions.

**Main Connections:**
- The model's structure includes connections between the hidden states and observation modalities, with the following key interactions:
  - Hidden states (s_f0 and s_f1) influence the likelihood matrices (A_m0, A_m1, A_m2) for different observation modalities.
  - The control factor (u_f1) primarily affects the transition matrix (B_f1) for the decision state while B_f0 remains uncontrolled.
  - Observations feed into the expected free energy (G), which in turn influences the policy distribution (Ï€_f1) for decision-making.
  
**Overall Structure:**
The model is designed for dynamic and discrete-time processes, aiming to infer the states based on observations, derive policies, and sample actions to optimize decision-making based on expected free energy. It leverages the mathematical representations of states, observations, and transitions to maintain a coherent decision-making framework.
