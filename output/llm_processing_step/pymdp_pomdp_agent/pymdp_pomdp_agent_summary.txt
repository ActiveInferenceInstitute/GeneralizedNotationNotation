### Summary of the Multifactor PyMDP Agent GNN Model

**Model Name:** Multifactor PyMDP Agent v1

**Purpose:** This model represents a PyMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) agent designed for active inference with multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors. It aims to enable decision-making processes by inferring states and policies based on observations and hidden states.

**Key Components:**
- **Observation Modalities:**
  - **State Observation:** 3 outcomes
  - **Reward:** 3 outcomes
  - **Decision Proprioceptive:** 3 outcomes

- **Hidden State Factors:**
  - **Reward Level:** 2 states
  - **Decision State:** 3 states

- **Control:** The decision state is controllable, allowing for 3 possible actions.

**Main Connections:**
- The model employs **A_matrices** to define the likelihood of observations given hidden states.
- **B_matrices** represent state transitions for the hidden factors, with B_f1 being influenced by actions determined by the policy (Ï€_f1).
- **C_vectors** encapsulate preferences for each observation modality.
- **D_vectors** provide priors over hidden states.
- The model's dynamics are encoded through connections between hidden states, observations, control actions, and expected free energy (G), enabling policy updates and decisions based on the inferred states and observations.

This structured approach allows the agent to update its beliefs about the world and adjust its actions accordingly, supporting sophisticated decision-making in uncertain environments.
