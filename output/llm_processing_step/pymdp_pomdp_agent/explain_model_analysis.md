### 1. Model Purpose

The **Multifactor PyMDP Agent** model represents a decision-making agent that operates in a partially observable environment, where it must infer hidden states based on multiple observation modalities. This model is particularly relevant for scenarios where an agent must learn from its environment, make decisions based on uncertain information, and optimize its actions to maximize expected rewards. Such applications can be found in robotics, autonomous systems, and cognitive modeling, where agents must navigate complex environments with limited information.

### 2. Core Components

#### Hidden States
- **s_f0 (Reward Level)**: This hidden state has 2 possible values, representing the level of reward the agent perceives or expects in the environment. It captures the agent's internal assessment of the reward structure.
- **s_f1 (Decision State)**: This hidden state has 3 possible values, reflecting the agent's current decision-making context. It indicates which decision-making strategy or state the agent is currently in, influencing its behavior.

#### Observations
- **o_m0 (State Observation)**: This modality consists of 3 outcomes that represent the agent's observations of the environment's state. It captures the agent's perception of the current situation.
- **o_m1 (Reward Observation)**: This modality also has 3 outcomes, indicating the perceived reward from the environment. It informs the agent about the potential rewards associated with its actions.
- **o_m2 (Decision Proprioceptive Observation)**: This modality consists of 3 outcomes that reflect the agent's internal state regarding its decision-making process. It provides feedback on the agent's own actions and their effectiveness.

#### Actions/Controls
- **u_f1 (Action Factor 1)**: This variable represents the action taken by the agent in the decision-making context (s_f1). It can take one of 3 possible actions, allowing the agent to influence its environment based on its current state.
- **π_f1 (Policy Vector Factor 1)**: This policy vector defines the distribution over possible actions based on the current belief about the hidden states. It is derived from the expected free energy (G) and guides the agent's decision-making process.

### 3. Model Dynamics

The model evolves over discrete time steps, where the following key relationships govern its dynamics:

1. **State Inference**: The agent infers its hidden states (s_f0 and s_f1) based on the observations (o_m0, o_m1, o_m2) using the likelihood matrices (A_m0, A_m1, A_m2). This process updates the agent's beliefs about the hidden states based on incoming sensory data.

2. **State Transition**: The hidden states transition over time according to the transition matrices (B_f0 and B_f1). The transitions for s_f0 are uncontrolled, while s_f1 transitions depend on the action taken (u_f1), allowing the agent to influence its decision-making state.

3. **Action Sampling**: The agent samples actions based on the policy (π_f1), which is informed by the expected free energy (G). This policy guides the agent's behavior to minimize uncertainty and maximize expected rewards.

4. **Expected Free Energy**: The expected free energy (G) is computed from the preferences (C_m0, C_m1, C_m2) and is used to evaluate the desirability of different policies, guiding the agent's decision-making process.

### 4. Active Inference Context

This model implements **Active Inference** principles by continuously updating beliefs about hidden states based on observations and actions. The key beliefs being updated include:

- The agent's beliefs about the reward level (s_f0) and decision state (s_f1) based on the observations it receives.
- The expected outcomes of actions, which are evaluated through the expected free energy (G). The agent aims to minimize this free energy by selecting actions that lead to more certain and rewarding states.

By actively sampling actions and updating beliefs, the agent engages in a feedback loop that allows it to adapt its behavior based on the observed outcomes, ultimately leading to improved decision-making over time.

### 5. Practical Implications

Using this model, one can predict the agent's behavior in various scenarios, such as:

- **Decision-Making**: The model can inform how the agent will act in response to different environmental states, helping to understand its strategies for maximizing rewards.
- **Learning**: The agent's ability to update its beliefs allows it to learn from experience, making it suitable for applications where adaptive behavior is crucial, such as in reinforcement learning contexts.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Researchers can analyze how changes in the observation modalities or reward structures affect the agent's decision-making process, providing insights into optimal strategies for various tasks.

In summary, the Multifactor PyMDP Agent model serves as a robust framework for understanding decision-making in uncertain environments, leveraging Active Inference principles to adaptively learn and optimize behavior based on sensory inputs and internal states.
