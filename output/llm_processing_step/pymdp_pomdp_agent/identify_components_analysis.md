Here’s a systematic breakdown of the GNN specification for the Multifactor PyMDP Agent, focusing on the components relevant to Active Inference.

### 1. State Variables (Hidden States)
- **Variable Names and Dimensions**:
  - `s_f0[2,1]`: Hidden state for factor 0 ("reward_level") with 2 states.
  - `s_f1[3,1]`: Hidden state for factor 1 ("decision_state") with 3 states.
  - `s_prime_f0[2,1]`: Next hidden state for factor 0.
  - `s_prime_f1[3,1]`: Next hidden state for factor 1.

- **Conceptual Representation**:
  - `s_f0`: Represents the level of reward the agent perceives, with two discrete states (e.g., low and high).
  - `s_f1`: Represents the decision-making state of the agent, with three discrete states (e.g., different decision strategies or contexts).

- **State Space Structure**:
  - Both hidden state factors are discrete and finite, with a defined number of states for each factor.

### 2. Observation Variables
- **Observation Modalities and Meanings**:
  - `o_m0[3,1]`: Observations related to the "state_observation" modality with 3 possible outcomes.
  - `o_m1[3,1]`: Observations related to the "reward" modality with 3 possible outcomes.
  - `o_m2[3,1]`: Observations related to the "decision_proprioceptive" modality with 3 possible outcomes.

- **Sensor/Measurement Interpretations**:
  - Each observation modality corresponds to different aspects of the environment or internal states that the agent can perceive. For instance, `o_m0` may represent sensory data about the environment, while `o_m1` reflects the perceived reward.

- **Noise Models or Uncertainty Characterization**:
  - The likelihood matrices `A_m0`, `A_m1`, and `A_m2` define the probabilistic relationships between hidden states and observations, capturing the uncertainty inherent in the observation process.

### 3. Action/Control Variables
- **Available Actions and Effects**:
  - `u_f1[1]`: Represents the action taken for the controllable factor 1 (decision state), which has 3 possible actions.
  - The action space is defined by the transitions in `B_f1`, which indicates how actions affect the decision state.

- **Control Policies and Decision Variables**:
  - `π_f1[3]`: Represents the policy distribution over actions for factor 1, derived from the expected free energy `G`.

- **Action Space Properties**:
  - The action space is discrete, with a defined number of actions available for decision-making. The transitions in `B_f1` are influenced by the chosen action.

### 4. Model Matrices
- **A Matrices (Observation Models)**:
  - `A_m0`, `A_m1`, `A_m2`: These matrices define the likelihood of observing specific outcomes given the hidden state factors. They capture the conditional probabilities \( P(o | s) \) for each observation modality.

- **B Matrices (Transition Dynamics)**:
  - `B_f0`: Transition dynamics for the uncontrolled factor 0, indicating that the next state is determined by the current state without any action influence.
  - `B_f1`: Transition dynamics for the controlled factor 1, indicating how actions influence the next state.

- **C Matrices (Preferences/Goals)**:
  - `C_m0`, `C_m1`, `C_m2`: These vectors represent the preferences or goals associated with each observation modality, influencing the expected free energy calculation.

- **D Matrices (Prior Beliefs)**:
  - `D_f0`, `D_f1`: These vectors represent the prior beliefs over the hidden states, initialized uniformly in this model.

### 5. Parameters and Hyperparameters
- **Precision Parameters**:
  - The model does not explicitly define precision parameters (e.g., γ, α) in the provided specification. However, these could be inferred from the learning process or additional model configurations.

- **Learning Rates and Adaptation Parameters**:
  - The specification does not detail learning rates or adaptation parameters, suggesting that the model may rely on fixed parameters for the initial setup.

- **Fixed vs. Learnable Parameters**:
  - The matrices `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` are defined with fixed values in the initial parameterization, indicating they are not learnable in this context.

### 6. Temporal Structure
- **Time Horizons and Temporal Dependencies**:
  - The model is defined to operate in a discrete time framework (`DiscreteTime=t`), with an unbounded time horizon (`ModelTimeHorizon=Unbounded`), indicating that the agent can continue to operate indefinitely.

- **Dynamic vs. Static Components**:
  - The model incorporates dynamic components through the transition matrices and the policy updates, allowing the agent to adapt its behavior over time based on observations and actions.

This breakdown provides a comprehensive overview of the GNN specification for the Multifactor PyMDP Agent, highlighting the key components and their roles within the Active Inference framework.
