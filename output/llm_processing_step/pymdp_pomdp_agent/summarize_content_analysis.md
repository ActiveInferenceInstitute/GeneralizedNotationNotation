### Model Overview
The **Multifactor PyMDP Agent** is a probabilistic model designed for active inference within a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework. It incorporates multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors, enabling the agent to infer states, update beliefs, and make decisions based on a variety of sensory inputs and internal states.

### Key Variables
- **Hidden States**:
  - **s_f0**: Represents the "reward_level" with 2 possible states, indicating the level of reward perceived by the agent.
  - **s_f1**: Represents the "decision_state" with 3 possible states, reflecting the agent's current decision-making status.

- **Observations**:
  - **o_m0**: Observations related to the "state_observation" modality with 3 possible outcomes.
  - **o_m1**: Observations related to the "reward" modality with 3 possible outcomes.
  - **o_m2**: Observations related to the "decision_proprioceptive" modality with 3 possible outcomes.

- **Actions/Controls**:
  - **u_f1**: The action taken for the controllable factor "decision_state," which can take on 3 possible actions.
  - **Ï€_f1**: The policy vector representing the distribution over actions for the controllable factor.

### Critical Parameters
- **Matrices**:
  - **A_m0, A_m1, A_m2**: Likelihood matrices for each observation modality, defining how observations relate to hidden states.
  - **B_f0**: Transition matrix for the "reward_level" factor, indicating state transitions without control.
  - **B_f1**: Transition matrix for the "decision_state" factor, indicating state transitions influenced by actions.
  - **C_m0, C_m1, C_m2**: Preference vectors for each observation modality, influencing the agent's preferences in decision-making.
  - **D_f0, D_f1**: Prior distributions over hidden states, representing initial beliefs about the hidden states.

- **Key Hyperparameters**:
  - Number of hidden states for factors: [2, 3] (for s_f0 and s_f1, respectively).
  - Number of observation modalities: [3, 3, 3] (for o_m0, o_m1, o_m2).
  - Control factors: [1, 3] (indicating one uncontrolled factor and one controlled factor).

### Notable Features
- The model employs a multifactor structure, allowing for the simultaneous consideration of multiple hidden states and observation modalities.
- It includes both controlled and uncontrolled state transitions, providing flexibility in how the agent interacts with its environment.
- The use of expected free energy (G) as a guiding principle for decision-making highlights the model's foundation in active inference, emphasizing the minimization of uncertainty and the pursuit of preferred states.

### Use Cases
This model is applicable in scenarios where agents need to make decisions based on uncertain and multimodal sensory inputs, such as robotics, autonomous navigation, and adaptive learning systems. It is particularly suited for environments where both internal states (like reward levels) and external observations (like sensory data) must be integrated to inform actions effectively.
