# Summary of the Multifactor PyMDP Agent GNN Specification

## Model Overview
The Multifactor PyMDP Agent is a probabilistic model designed to represent an agent operating within a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework. It incorporates multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors, allowing for complex decision-making and state inference based on various inputs and control actions.

## Key Variables
- **Hidden States**:
  - `s_f0`: Represents the "reward_level" with 2 discrete states (e.g., low and high reward).
  - `s_f1`: Represents the "decision_state" with 3 discrete states (e.g., different decision-making contexts).
  
- **Observations**:
  - `o_m0`: Observations related to "state_observation" with 3 possible outcomes.
  - `o_m1`: Observations related to "reward" with 3 possible outcomes.
  - `o_m2`: Observations related to "decision_proprioceptive" with 3 possible outcomes.

- **Actions/Controls**:
  - `u_f1`: The action taken for the controllable factor `s_f1`, which can take 3 different actions.
  - `Ï€_f1`: The policy distribution over actions for the controllable factor `s_f1`.

## Critical Parameters
- **Matrices**:
  - **A_m** (Likelihood Matrices): 
    - `A_m0`, `A_m1`, `A_m2`: Define the likelihood of observations given the hidden states for each modality. Each matrix has dimensions corresponding to the number of outcomes and hidden state factors.
  - **B_f** (Transition Matrices):
    - `B_f0`: Transition dynamics for the uncontrolled hidden state factor `s_f0`.
    - `B_f1`: Transition dynamics for the controlled hidden state factor `s_f1`, influenced by actions.
  - **C_m** (Preference Vectors): 
    - `C_m0`, `C_m1`, `C_m2`: Log preferences for each observation modality, influencing the agent's expected free energy.
  - **D_f** (Prior Vectors):
    - `D_f0`, `D_f1`: Priors over the hidden states for the respective factors, initialized uniformly.

- **Key Hyperparameters**:
  - Number of hidden states for factors: `[2, 3]` (for `s_f0` and `s_f1`).
  - Number of observation modalities: `[3, 3, 3]` (for `o_m0`, `o_m1`, `o_m2`).
  - Control factors: `[1, 3]` (indicating one uncontrolled and one controlled factor).

## Notable Features
- The model employs a multifactor approach, allowing for the integration of diverse observation modalities and hidden state factors, enhancing its representational capacity.
- It utilizes a dynamic, discrete-time framework with unbounded time horizons, making it suitable for continuous decision-making scenarios.
- The design includes specific equations for state inference, policy inference, and action sampling, aligning with standard PyMDP methodologies.

## Use Cases
This model is applicable in scenarios requiring complex decision-making under uncertainty, such as robotics, autonomous agents, and adaptive systems where multiple sensory inputs and hidden states must be managed simultaneously. It can be used in environments where agents must learn and adapt their behavior based on varying rewards and states, making it suitable for reinforcement learning applications.
