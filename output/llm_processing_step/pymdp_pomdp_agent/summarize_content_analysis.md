### Model Overview
The **Multifactor PyMDP Agent** is a probabilistic model designed to represent an agent operating under the principles of Active Inference within a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework. This model incorporates multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors, allowing it to infer states, update beliefs, and make decisions based on various sensory inputs and internal states.

### Key Variables
- **Hidden States**:
  - **s_f0**: Represents the "reward_level" with 2 possible states, indicating the level of reward perceived by the agent.
  - **s_f1**: Represents the "decision_state" with 3 possible states, indicating the current decision-making context of the agent.

- **Observations**:
  - **o_m0**: Observations related to "state_observation" with 3 outcomes, providing sensory input about the environment.
  - **o_m1**: Observations related to "reward" with 3 outcomes, reflecting the perceived reward signals.
  - **o_m2**: Observations related to "decision_proprioceptive" with 3 outcomes, indicating the agent's internal decision-making status.

- **Actions/Controls**:
  - **u_f1**: The action taken for the controllable factor "decision_state," which can take on 3 possible actions.
  - **Ï€_f1**: Policy vector representing the distribution over actions for the controllable factor, guiding the agent's decision-making process.

### Critical Parameters
- **Matrices**:
  - **A_m0, A_m1, A_m2**: Likelihood matrices for each observation modality, defining how observations relate to hidden states.
  - **B_f0**: Transition matrix for the uncontrolled hidden state "reward_level," indicating state transitions without action influence.
  - **B_f1**: Transition matrix for the controlled hidden state "decision_state," detailing how actions influence state transitions.
  - **C_m0, C_m1, C_m2**: Preference vectors for each modality, influencing the agent's internal motivations and beliefs.
  - **D_f0, D_f1**: Prior distributions over hidden states, providing initial beliefs about the states before observations are made.

- **Key Hyperparameters**:
  - Number of hidden states: [2, 3] for factors s_f0 and s_f1, respectively.
  - Number of observation modalities: [3, 3, 3] for o_m0, o_m1, and o_m2.
  - Control factors: 1 uncontrolled (B_f0) and 3 controlled actions (B_f1).

### Notable Features
- The model incorporates multiple observation modalities, allowing it to process diverse types of sensory information simultaneously.
- It features a combination of controlled and uncontrolled hidden state transitions, enabling flexible decision-making based on both internal and external factors.
- The design is rooted in the principles of Active Inference, emphasizing belief updating and expected free energy minimization as core operational mechanisms.

### Use Cases
This model can be applied in scenarios requiring complex decision-making under uncertainty, such as robotics, autonomous systems, and cognitive modeling. It is particularly useful in environments where agents must integrate multiple sources of information to make informed decisions, adapt to changing circumstances, and optimize their actions based on expected outcomes.
