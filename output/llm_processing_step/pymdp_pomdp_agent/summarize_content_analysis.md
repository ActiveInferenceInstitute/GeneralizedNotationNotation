### Model Overview
The **Multifactor PyMDP Agent** is a probabilistic model designed within the framework of Active Inference, representing an agent that utilizes multiple observation modalities and hidden state factors to make decisions. It employs a PyMDP (Python Markov Decision Process) structure to infer states, policies, and actions, enabling it to adaptively control its behavior based on the observed environment.

### Key Variables
- **Hidden States**:
  - **s_f0**: Represents the "reward_level" with 2 discrete states, indicating the level of reward perceived by the agent.
  - **s_f1**: Represents the "decision_state" with 3 discrete states, reflecting the agent's current decision-making status.

- **Observations**:
  - **o_m0**: Observation modality for "state_observation" with 3 potential outcomes, capturing the agent's perception of its state.
  - **o_m1**: Observation modality for "reward" with 3 outcomes, indicating the reward signals received by the agent.
  - **o_m2**: Observation modality for "decision_proprioceptive" with 3 outcomes, reflecting the agent's internal decision-making feedback.

- **Actions/Controls**:
  - **u_f1**: The action taken for the controllable factor "decision_state," which can take 3 possible actions.
  - **Ï€_f1**: Policy distribution over actions for the "decision_state," guiding the agent's choice based on inferred states.

### Critical Parameters
- **Matrices**:
  - **A_m0, A_m1, A_m2**: Likelihood matrices for each observation modality, defining how observations relate to hidden states.
  - **B_f0**: Transition matrix for the "reward_level," indicating state transitions without control (uncontrolled).
  - **B_f1**: Transition matrix for the "decision_state," detailing how actions influence state transitions.
  - **C_m0, C_m1, C_m2**: Log preference vectors for each modality, influencing the agent's preferences over observations.
  - **D_f0, D_f1**: Prior distributions over hidden states, representing initial beliefs about the states before observing evidence.

- **Key Hyperparameters**:
  - Number of hidden states: [2, 3] for factors s_f0 and s_f1.
  - Number of observation modalities: [3, 3, 3] for o_m0, o_m1, and o_m2.
  - Control factors: [1, 3], indicating one uncontrolled factor and one controlled factor with three actions.

### Notable Features
- The model incorporates multiple observation modalities, allowing for a richer representation of the environment.
- It features both controlled and uncontrolled state transitions, enabling flexibility in decision-making processes.
- The design supports dynamic inference of states and policies, making it suitable for environments where the agent must adaptively learn from its experiences.

### Use Cases
This model can be applied in scenarios such as:
- Autonomous agents in robotics, where the agent must navigate and make decisions based on varying sensory inputs.
- Reinforcement learning tasks where an agent learns to optimize its behavior based on rewards and state observations.
- Cognitive modeling in psychology, simulating how humans might infer states and make decisions based on multiple sources of information.
