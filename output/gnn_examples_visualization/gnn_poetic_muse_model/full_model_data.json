  "ModelAnnotation": "This model represents a Bayesian Network that stochastically generates a \"verse concept\" based on hierarchical creative influences.\nIt aims to model the flow of poetic inspiration from abstract emotional and elemental inputs to concrete poetic characteristics.\nThe model demonstrates:\n- A non-POMDP generative structure.\n- Interdependent latent variables (states).\n- Use of priors for root variables and Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) for dependent variables.\n- An observable \"quality\" estimate derived from the final verse concept.\n- Rich annotations for ontology mapping and LLM processing.\nThis model is designed to test GNN parsing, type-checking, export, visualization, and ontology features.\nIt is not directly renderable to standard PyMDP/RxInfer POMDP simulators without a custom BN renderer.",
