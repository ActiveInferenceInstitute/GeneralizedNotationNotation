## ModelName
The Generative Poetic Muse v1.0

## ModelAnnotation
This model represents a Bayesian Network that stochastically generates a "verse concept" based on hierarchical creative influences.
It aims to model the flow of poetic inspiration from abstract emotional and elemental inputs to concrete poetic characteristics.
The model demonstrates:
- A non-POMDP generative structure.
- Interdependent latent variables (states).
- Use of priors for root variables and Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) for dependent variables.
- An observable "quality" estimate derived from the final verse concept.
- Rich annotations for ontology mapping and LLM processing.
This model is designed to test GNN parsing, type-checking, export, visualization, and ontology features.
It is not directly renderable to standard PyMDP/RxInfer POMDP simulators without a custom BN renderer.

## Equations
# This model represents a Bayesian Network. The joint probability distribution is:
# P(s_v0, ..., s_v8, o_m0) = P(s_v0) * P(s_v1) * P(s_v2) *
#                           P(s_v3 | s_v0, s_v1) * P(s_v4 | s_v0) * P(s_v5 | s_v1) *
#                           P(s_v6 | s_v3, s_v2) * P(s_v7 | s_v4, s_v5) *
#                           P(s_v8 | s_v6, s_v7, s_v3) * P(o_m0 | s_v8)
# Inference involves computing marginal or conditional probabilities based on this joint distribution.
# For generation, variables are sampled sequentially according to their conditional probabilities given their parents.

This model represents a Bayesian Network that stochastically generates a "verse concept" based on hierarchical creative influences.
It aims to model the flow of poetic inspiration from abstract emotional and elemental inputs to concrete poetic characteristics.
The model demonstrates:
- A non-POMDP generative structure.
- Interdependent latent variables (states).
- Use of priors for root variables and Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) for dependent variables.
- An observable "quality" estimate derived from the final verse concept.
- Rich annotations for ontology mapping and LLM processing.
This model is designed to test GNN parsing, type-checking, export, visualization, and ontology features.
It is not directly renderable to standard PyMDP/RxInfer POMDP simulators without a custom BN renderer.

### Equations

```
# This model represents a Bayesian Network. The joint probability distribution is:
# P(s_v0, ..., s_v8, o_m0) = P(s_v0) * P(s_v1) * P(s_v2) *
#                           P(s_v3 | s_v0, s_v1) * P(s_v4 | s_v0) * P(s_v5 | s_v1) *
#                           P(s_v6 | s_v3, s_v2) * P(s_v7 | s_v4, s_v5) *
#                           P(s_v8 | s_v6, s_v7, s_v3) * P(o_m0 | s_v8)
# Inference involves computing marginal or conditional probabilities based on this joint distribution.
# For generation, variables are sampled sequentially according to their conditional probabilities given their parents.
