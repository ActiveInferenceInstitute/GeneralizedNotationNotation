/// GNN Model: Active Inference Chronic Pain Multi-Theory Model v1
/// Annotation: This model integrates multiple coherent theories of chronic pain mechanisms across THREE NESTED CONTINUOUS TIMESCALES:

**Multi-Theory Integration:**
- Peripheral Sensitization: Enhanced nociceptor responsiveness and reduced thresholds (slow timescale)
- Central Sensitization: Amplified CNS processing and reduced inhibition (slow timescale, one-way process)
- Gate Control Theory: Spinal modulation of ascending pain signals (fast timescale)
- Neuromatrix Theory: Distributed network generating pain experience (fast-medium coupling)
- Predictive Coding: Pain as precision-weighted prediction error (all timescales)
- Biopsychosocial Integration: Cognitive, emotional, and behavioral factors (medium timescale)

**Three Nested Timescales:**
1. Fast (ms-s): Neural signaling, gate control, descending modulation, acute pain perception
2. Medium (min-hrs): Cognitive-affective processes, behavioral strategies, functional capacity
3. Slow (hrs-days): Tissue healing, peripheral/central sensitization, chronic adaptations

**State Space Structure:**
- Six hidden state factors (378 combinations): tissue state (slow), peripheral sensitivity (slow), spinal gate (fast), central sensitization (slow), descending modulation (fast), cognitive-affective state (medium)
- Four observation modalities (72 outcomes): pain intensity (fast), pain quality (fast), functional capacity (medium), autonomic response (fast)
- Four control factors (81 actions): attention allocation (medium), behavioral strategy (medium), cognitive reappraisal (medium), descending control (fast)

**Key Features:**
- Timescale separation: ε (fast/medium) ≈ 10^-3, δ (medium/slow) ≈ 10^-2
- Cross-timescale coupling: slow states modulate fast dynamics, fast observations (averaged) drive medium cognition, medium behaviors (averaged) influence slow healing
- Testable predictions about pain chronification pathways across multiple timescales
- Intervention targets at each timescale: fast (descending control), medium (CBT/behavioral), slow (prevent sensitization)

/* MODEL_DATA: {"model_name":"Active Inference Chronic Pain Multi-Theory Model v1","annotation":"This model integrates multiple coherent theories of chronic pain mechanisms across THREE NESTED CONTINUOUS TIMESCALES:\n\n**Multi-Theory Integration:**\n- Peripheral Sensitization: Enhanced nociceptor responsiveness and reduced thresholds (slow timescale)\n- Central Sensitization: Amplified CNS processing and reduced inhibition (slow timescale, one-way process)\n- Gate Control Theory: Spinal modulation of ascending pain signals (fast timescale)\n- Neuromatrix Theory: Distributed network generating pain experience (fast-medium coupling)\n- Predictive Coding: Pain as precision-weighted prediction error (all timescales)\n- Biopsychosocial Integration: Cognitive, emotional, and behavioral factors (medium timescale)\n\n**Three Nested Timescales:**\n1. Fast (ms-s): Neural signaling, gate control, descending modulation, acute pain perception\n2. Medium (min-hrs): Cognitive-affective processes, behavioral strategies, functional capacity\n3. Slow (hrs-days): Tissue healing, peripheral/central sensitization, chronic adaptations\n\n**State Space Structure:**\n- Six hidden state factors (378 combinations): tissue state (slow), peripheral sensitivity (slow), spinal gate (fast), central sensitization (slow), descending modulation (fast), cognitive-affective state (medium)\n- Four observation modalities (72 outcomes): pain intensity (fast), pain quality (fast), functional capacity (medium), autonomic response (fast)\n- Four control factors (81 actions): attention allocation (medium), behavioral strategy (medium), cognitive reappraisal (medium), descending control (fast)\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Timescale separation: \u03b5 (fast/medium) \u2248 10^-3, \u03b4 (medium/slow) \u2248 10^-2\n- Cross-timescale coupling: slow states modulate fast dynamics, fast observations (averaged) drive medium cognition, medium behaviors (averaged) influence slow healing\n- Testable predictions about pain chronification pathways across multiple timescales\n- Intervention targets at each timescale: fast (descending control), medium (CBT/behavioral), slow (prevent sensitization)","variables":[{"name":"A","var_type":"likelihood_matrix","data_type":"float","dimensions":[72,378]},{"name":"B","var_type":"transition_matrix","data_type":"float","dimensions":[378,378,81]},{"name":"C","var_type":"preference_vector","data_type":"float","dimensions":[72]},{"name":"D","var_type":"prior_vector","data_type":"float","dimensions":[378]},{"name":"E","var_type":"policy","data_type":"float","dimensions":[81]},{"name":"T","var_type":"hidden_state","data_type":"float","dimensions":[3,1]},{"name":"P_sens","var_type":"hidden_state","data_type":"float","dimensions":[3,1]},{"name":"G","var_type":"policy","data_type":"float","dimensions":[3,1]},{"name":"C_sens","var_type":"hidden_state","data_type":"float","dimensions":[2,1]},{"name":"D_mod","var_type":"hidden_state","data_type":"float","dimensions":[3,1]},{"name":"Cog","var_type":"hidden_state","data_type":"float","dimensions":[7,1]},{"name":"Pain_I","var_type":"hidden_state","data_type":"float","dimensions":[4,1]},{"name":"Pain_Q","var_type":"hidden_state","data_type":"float","dimensions":[3,1]},{"name":"Func","var_type":"hidden_state","data_type":"float","dimensions":[3,1]},{"name":"Auto","var_type":"action","data_type":"float","dimensions":[2,1]},{"name":"Attn","var_type":"action","data_type":"float","dimensions":[3,1]},{"name":"Behav","var_type":"hidden_state","data_type":"float","dimensions":[3,1]},{"name":"Reapp","var_type":"hidden_state","data_type":"float","dimensions":[3,1]},{"name":"Desc_C","var_type":"hidden_state","data_type":"float","dimensions":[3,1]},{"name":"F","var_type":"hidden_state","data_type":"float","dimensions":[1]},{"name":"G","var_type":"policy","data_type":"float","dimensions":[1]},{"name":"t_fast","var_type":"hidden_state","data_type":"float","dimensions":[1]},{"name":"t_medium","var_type":"hidden_state","data_type":"float","dimensions":[1]},{"name":"t_slow","var_type":"hidden_state","data_type":"float","dimensions":[1]}],"connections":[{"source_variables":["D"],"target_variables":["T"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["D"],"target_variables":["P_sens"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["D"],"target_variables":["C_sens"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["D"],"target_variables":["Cog"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["T"],"target_variables":["P_sens"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["P_sens"],"target_variables":["B"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["P_sens"],"target_variables":["G"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["D_mod"],"target_variables":["G"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["G"],"target_variables":["B"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["G"],"target_variables":["C_sens"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["C_sens"],"target_variables":["B"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["T"],"target_variables":["C_sens"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["Cog"],"target_variables":["D_mod"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["D_mod"],"target_variables":["B"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["Pain_I"],"target_variables":["Cog"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["Func"],"target_variables":["Cog"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["Cog"],"target_variables":["B"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["T"],"target_variables":["A"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["P_sens"],"target_variables":["A"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["G"],"target_variables":["A"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["C_sens"],"target_variables":["A"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["D_mod"],"target_variables":["A"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["Cog"],"target_variables":["A"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["Attn"],"target_variables":["Cog"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["Behav"],"target_variables":["T"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["Behav"],"target_variables":["Func"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["Reapp"],"target_variables":["Cog"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["Desc_C"],"target_variables":["D_mod"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["C"],"target_variables":["G"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["E"],"target_variables":["Attn"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["E"],"target_variables":["Behav"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["G"],"target_variables":["Attn"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["G"],"target_variables":["Behav"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["G"],"target_variables":["Reapp"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["G"],"target_variables":["Desc_C"],"connection_type":"directed"},{"source_variables":["Attn"],"target_variables":["Behav"],"c
