  "annotation": "This model integrates multiple coherent theories of chronic pain mechanisms across THREE NESTED CONTINUOUS TIMESCALES:\n\n**Multi-Theory Integration:**\n- Peripheral Sensitization: Enhanced nociceptor responsiveness and reduced thresholds (slow timescale)\n- Central Sensitization: Amplified CNS processing and reduced inhibition (slow timescale, one-way process)\n- Gate Control Theory: Spinal modulation of ascending pain signals (fast timescale)\n- Neuromatrix Theory: Distributed network generating pain experience (fast-medium coupling)\n- Predictive Coding: Pain as precision-weighted prediction error (all timescales)\n- Biopsychosocial Integration: Cognitive, emotional, and behavioral factors (medium timescale)\n\n**Three Nested Timescales:**\n1. Fast (ms-s): Neural signaling, gate control, descending modulation, acute pain perception\n2. Medium (min-hrs): Cognitive-affective processes, behavioral strategies, functional capacity\n3. Slow (hrs-days): Tissue healing, peripheral/central sensitization, chronic adaptations\n\n**State Space Structure:**\n- Six hidden state factors (378 combinations): tissue state (slow), peripheral sensitivity (slow), spinal gate (fast), central sensitization (slow), descending modulation (fast), cognitive-affective state (medium)\n- Four observation modalities (72 outcomes): pain intensity (fast), pain quality (fast), functional capacity (medium), autonomic response (fast)\n- Four control factors (81 actions): attention allocation (medium), behavioral strategy (medium), cognitive reappraisal (medium), descending control (fast)\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Timescale separation: ε (fast/medium) ≈ 10^-3, δ (medium/slow) ≈ 10^-2\n- Cross-timescale coupling: slow states modulate fast dynamics, fast observations (averaged) drive medium cognition, medium behaviors (averaged) influence slow healing\n- Testable predictions about pain chronification pathways across multiple timescales\n- Intervention targets at each timescale: fast (descending control), medium (CBT/behavioral), slow (prevent sensitization)",

Testing competing hypotheses about pain chronification mechanisms across multiple timescales\n2. Simulating different patient populations (acute, chronic, high-risk, resilient)\n3. Evaluating intervention strategies with timescale-specific effects (behavioral, cognitive, pharmacological)\n4. Predicting individual trajectories based on baseline states and coping strategies\n5. Identifying critical transition points from acute to chronic pain\n6. Understanding multi-rate dynamics from immediate pain modulation to long-term chronification\n7. Designing interventions targeting specific timescales (fast: descending control, medium: CBT, slow: tissue healing)\n\n**Key testable predictions (with timescale specificity):**\n- Central sensitization (slow) as a \"point of no return\" in chronic pain development\n- Gate control effectiveness (fast) via descending modulation with immediate pain reduction\n- Fear-avoidance cycles (medium) leading to disability independent of tissue state\n- Cognitive reappraisal (medium→fast) as pathway to pain reduction via descending inhibition\n- Peripheral vs central contributions (slow) to pain in different patient phenotypes\n- Timescale interactions driving the transition from acute to chronic pain\n- Intervention windows: fast (immediate relief), medium (coping strategies), slow (prevent sensitization)",
