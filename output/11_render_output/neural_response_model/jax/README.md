Generated from GNN POMDP Model: **Active Inference Neural Response Model v1**

## Model Information

- **Model Name**: Active Inference Neural Response Model v1
- **Model Description**: This model describes how a neuron responds to stimuli using Active Inference principles:
- One primary observation modality (firing_rate) with 4 possible activity levels
- Two auxiliary observation modalities (postsynaptic_potential, calcium_signal) for comprehensive monitoring
- Five hidden state factors representing different aspects of neural computation
- Three control factors for plasticity, channel modulation, and metabolic allocation
- The model captures key neural phenomena: membrane potential dynamics, synaptic plasticity (STDP-like), activity-dependent adaptation, homeostatic regulation, and metabolic constraints
- Preferences encode biologically realistic goals: stable firing rates, energy efficiency, and synaptic balance
- **Generation Date**: 2025-10-02 10:52:23
