      "llm_summary": "Here's the complete text with the relevant parts:\n\nGNN Model Description:\nThis section describes the Classic Active Inference model for a discrete POMDP where each observation has three possible outcomes (state_observation, hidden state_factor, and action), with a single state determined by one of three actions. Each action determines which observable is chosen. The policy maps states to observations, while the habit map allows the agent to move from previous states.\n\nThis model satisfies the following assumptions:\n\n1. **State inference**: Each observation has exactly 3 possible outcomes (observation_outcomes), and each action determines one of these outcomes. These actions are uniformly distributed across all observed states. The policy maps each state independently, and the habit map allows for decision-making in response to chosen actions.\n2. **Action selection**: Each agent chooses a single option from the available options based on an initial guess as input (policy_prior) that reflects its current knowledge base (\"habit\"). This process is repeated until a predefined set of choices are taken (influence), followed by planning for each observation in sequence.\n3. **Information rate**: The state-action gradient system converges to a predetermined action set with the goal realization being achieved eventually due to the agent's behavior and knowledge base optimizations (\"decision\"). As there is no prior information, it can be shown that each policy choice (actions) has an equal chance of leading to a solution.\n4. **Learning**: The learning mechanism iteratively updates the agents' probabilities in accordance with these decisions based on their own estimates about where they think actions will lead them (\"decision\"). As action choices are updated and new possibilities appear, this leads to an increasing convergence rate (fixed points) towards the goal realization.\n5. **Optimization**: Finally, the goal realizes a well-defined \"action set\" that consists of all possible policy combinations leading to correct decision among available actions (\"choices\") in sequence from initial guess input data provided by the agent's evaluation functions.",

        "summarize_content": "Your summary is excellent! It provides a clear overview of your understanding of the active inference agent implementation in Active Inference POMDP, as well as key parameters such as hidden states, actions, policy prior, and habit. \n\nTo further refine your analysis:\n\n1. **Key Variables**: Here are some relevant information to get started:\n   - Hidden state (represented by 'A') - A[observation_outcomes] or B[observations]. This represents the action taken at a particular time step based on prior probabilities in the policy posterior and actions, respectively.\n   - Observation (representing an observation) - A[observation_outcomes] or B[observations], which are used as inputs to implement the hypothesis states.\n\n2. **Critical Parameters**: Here is where you can gather relevant information:\n   - The number of hidden states: 3 and each hidden state has a certain probability distribution over actions, which affects how well we understand our actions based on these distributions. These probabilities determine where we will take action 'X' at time step 't'.\n   - The actions: Each action is represented by a vector of probabilities across all actions for the current action being considered.\n   - The policy and habit: For each observation, there are corresponding actions associated with the history of previous observations (choices) that were made prior to taking this particular action (actions).\n\n3. **Notable Features**: We will be using these features in our analysis:\n   - A key variable is hidden state/policy distribution across all actions and its relation to current observed outcomes, which affects how we understand our actions based on their probabilities across the previous observations.\n   - Actions are represented by a vector of probabilities corresponding to each action over time (observations).\n   - Hiding states in history allows us to deduce new information about the policy prior distribution across all actions at different times when applying the hypothesis state distributions and actions.\n\n4. **Use Cases**: What scenarios would this model be applied to? \n\nFor instance, if you want to apply the \"choose next action\" rule (the policy), we can use the 'ChooseNextAction' function:\n   ```python\n  def ChooseNextAction():\n    # Define our hidden state distributions and actions over history for the current observation.\n    A[observations] = [[(1.0, 0.9)], (1.0, 0.05),\n                ([(1.0, 0.8)]]).\n  # Apply this policy to each observation based on its probability across all actions from history\n    for i in range(len(observations)):\n      next_observation = action * A[observations][i].get('Observation', [[],[]])*actions[-2] + [action]\n          else:\n              next_observation = action * A[observations][i].get('Next Observation', [])\n            # Apply the policy to this observation based on its probability across all actions from history\n                from prev_observation = next_observation.copy()\n      self._performAction(next_observation, i)\n  ```\nWith the above code in place:\n   ```python\n  def _performAction(_action):\n    # Set up our action dictionary with our current and previous observations at each time step\n    A[observations][i] = 1 if next_observation.get('Observation', []).count(next_observation) == actions[-2].count(self._priorProbensity0)?\n        [A[obs + self._weightMatrix * (next_observation))]\n          else:\n              a=A[observations][i]['Next Observation']\n            \n  # Apply our policy to each observation based on its probability across all actions from history\n                next_observation = action*self.policy[[])\n                  prev_observation=''\n                  for i in range(len(observations)):\n                      next_observation=(next_observation + actions[prev_observation])[0]\n                   \n    return next_observation\n\n  # This will execute the chosen action and update our beliefs\n```",
        "explain_model": "You're on the right track! Here's a step-by-step guide to understanding the GNN framework:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The GNN consists of two main components:\n   - **StatePossession**: Each observation is assigned to one hidden state and that hidden state has an associated probability distribution over actions (`H[y,x]`) or policy (`G[h(s), y=1]`, where `g(s)` denotes the GNN transition operator).\n\n   - **Initialization**: The initial state of each observation is initialized with a random value and then mapped to hidden states. Each observation has an associated probability distribution over actions, which maps to a policy vector (`H[y])`.\n\n2. **Model Representation**: This model represents a general type of active inference agent:\n   - **Single-observation**: It assigns beliefs (facts) or decisions based on observed observations ($p(x)) and probabilities $P$ for the chosen action ([\u03c0]).\n\n   - **Multiple-observations**: It generates policies, actions, and hidden states in parallel using probability distributions. Each observation has an associated probability distribution over actions/policies with uniform policy prior (`g(s)`.\n\n3. **Constraints**: This model enforces bounds on beliefs based on observed data. The goal is to generate beliefs that are consistent with each action chosen by the agent, i.e., beliefs for all actions:\n\n   - **One-step history**: It generates histories of how the agents (and their policies/actions) change over time due to changes in observations and hidden states. It updates these beliefs based on a sequence of policy transitions (`G[g(s), y=1]`) until it reaches an empty horizon after each step:\n\n   - **One-step History**: The goal is to generate the transition matrix $(A, B)$ for each observation whose action ($y$) has been seen before. This can be done in a greedy way by choosing actions based on observed observations and then moving forward to other possible decisions.\n\n4. **Model Dynamics**: It implements Active Inference principles:\n   - **Policies**: Policies are defined based on the available data, i.e., there is no prior knowledge about what action will happen next for all actions. That is, it only knows of 3 options and doesn't know which one to choose.\n\n   - **Actions**: Actions can be defined by using a sequence of policy transitions or other initial guesses (actions) that are given at each time step in the history. There could potentially exist multiple policies with different objectives. This allows for a probabilistic graphical representation, where actions/policies change based on probability distributions and actions are constrained to take one action out of possible options:\n\n    - **One-step History**: This is the most intuitive scenario (every choice is made independently). In this case, there could be no prior knowledge about what action will happen next for all actions.\n\n5. **Active Inference Context**: It generates Actions/Policy histories based on its data collection strategy and initial beliefs ($p(x)$. Each observation can have a unique history, but each policy is defined in terms of previous policies with associated probabilities).\n\nPlease keep the following concepts:\n\n  *   **StatePossession** \u2013 What are the states (observations)?\n  *   **Observable Data** and **Data Collection**: How does it get data?\n  *   **Initial History**: What is a history of what actions were given at each time step in the history?\n  *   **Constraints**: What policies/actions must be defined to ensure that beliefs are consistent with actions.",

        "analyze_structure": "I've taken a detailed look at the graph properties, variable analysis, and mathematical structures for your Active Inference POMDP agent example:\n\nLet's dive deeper into some key aspects of the code.\n\n1. **Graph Structure**: We can't directly access the graph structure or compute its properties because they are stored in variables (\"LikelihoodMatrix\", \"TransitionMatrix\"). However, we can analyze the variables that describe a state and make inferences about other states and actions.\n\n2. **Variable Analysis**: We have an array of labeled inputs to each action selection, which may indicate some type of structure or mapping between actions and states:\n- Actions are connected as directed edges (directed edge) with a variable label (\"actions\" in the code), so we can analyze that \"outputs\":\n   - Outputs appear along the left-most axis of graph structure. \n   - In general, outputs seem to have categorical labels such as \"action\", but they don't necessarily follow a particular path or mechanism (e.g., \"action\") like output nodes in a directed graph.\n\n3. **Mathematical Structure**: The Graph Structure variable represents the overall state space of all states and actions: \n   - This structure is a grid-like domain with vertices labeled by action, which may indicate some type of hierarchical mapping between actions and states. \n\n4. **Variable Analysis**: We have an array of labeled inputs to each action selection (represented as \"outputs\") and can analyze these using variables (\"actions\"):\n   - Actions appear along the left-most axis of graph structure; in general, outputs seem to be categorical labels such as \"action\", but they don't necessarily follow a particular path or mechanism.\n\n5. **Mathematical Structure**: The Variable Analysis variable is annotated with the type of input (outputs), which allows us to evaluate its validity and potential behavior based on the action selection pattern:\n   - This property can help detect patterns in the graph structure that may reflect specific actions. For example, if an agent selects a particular action, there should be at least one output directed edge for that action.\n\n6. **Design Patterns**: The Graph Structure variable serves as a blueprint or template to generate possible actions based on the input inputs and predictions about their behavior:\n   - This allows us to define specific actions (outputs) in terms of potential outcomes/actions, which can be further analyzed using variables (\"outputs\"). \n\n7. **Complexity Assessment**: We've found that the graph structure exhibits some sort of hierarchical mapping between actions and states, where each action corresponds to a specific path or mechanism:\n   - This suggests that we should evaluate this graph structure based on its properties and complexity characteristics (i.e., its structure) rather than just the output values.\n\n8. **Design Patterns**: The Variable Analysis variable is annotated with the type of input (\"outputs\"), which allows us to evaluate its validity and potential behavior based on the action selection pattern:\n   - This evaluation can help identify patterns or behaviors, which may indicate specific actions (e.g., \"action\") that are likely to lead to a particular outcome/decision-making process.\n\nLet's summarize our findings for the graph structure analysis and variable analysis part of your code.\n\nIn conclusion, this code provides access to the graph structure and allows us to evaluate possible actions based on potential outcomes (outputs).

The GNN model has three different models for the state and hidden states distribution, each with its own set of parameters (observation_outcomes, probability_prior) and initial policies (habit).\n\n2. Each policy is represented as a vector of 3 probabilities over actions which are used to update the action selection based on the current observed observation i = i(1/H[i]), where H denotes an unbounded time horizon and is defined for each state transition in the GNN agent model.\n\n3. The habit has one observation per state (two policies). This allows for a flexible policy assignment across states, with no planning constraints allowed to change from one action into another based on actions. However, there are 4 actions available: Actions = [1] - Use explore_actions() method of the model and then use random initialization of initial hypothesis distributions in GNN agent implementation (this is where the parameterizations for input states come from).\n\n4. There's no prior over state distribution parameters but a habit which has one observation per state, corresponding to each policy. It uses the probability generated by the sequence of previous actions to update. \n\nSo far, it looks like there are 3 different GNN models with their own set of parameters and initial policies (observable) for input observations, action selection from policy posterior via habit estimation, and planning on the future observation horizon.
