# EXTRACT_PARAMETERS

I'll do the following:

1. **Model Matrices and Vector Fields**:
   - A matrix representing a model parameterized by `s` and `o`.
   
   - A vector field for each input observation, where each column is initialized with the corresponding value at that observation time step (based on sequence) or the action taken (base to which they are mapped).

2. **Precision Parameters**:
   - γ = α * s^(1/n), where n is the number of observations and σ*n denotes precision parameter range.
   
   - Alpha=α*(s+o)*(x/(n-1))

   - In practice, α is a small value to ensure that the prediction accuracy remains low for all cases.

3. **Dimensional Parameters**:
   - State space dimensions for each factor
   - Observation space dimensions for each modality
   - Action space dimensions for each control factor
4. **Temporal Parameters**:
   - Time horizons (T)
   
   - Temporal dependencies and windows to ensure the model is updated by a specific sequence of actions in a finite horizon.

5. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Initial parameter values
   
   
       - γ = α*(s+o)*(x/(n-1))
       
       - alpha * s^(1/n)
          
         - α*β
           
            0
6. **Configuration Summary**:
   - Parameter file format recommendations and initialization strategies for each parameters and fields.
