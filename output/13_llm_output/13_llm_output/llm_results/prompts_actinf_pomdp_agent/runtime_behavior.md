# Runtime Behavior

Prompt:

> Describe what happens when this GNN model runs and how it would behave in different settings or domains.

Response:

Your understanding is spot on! Here's the full code with some additional information:

1. **Action Selection**: For each observation in the simulation, you can use a function that takes an action as input and returns its corresponding probability value based on the following steps:
   - The input actions are encoded using dictionary-based inference protocols (e.g., "state_observation") or by storing them into a list of tuples ("policy", "action"). Each tuple represents a distinct observation with different values for each observation. This allows you to specify an initial policy and initialize the probability distribution based on these preferences.
   - The probabilities in this sequence are computed using Bayes' theorem, where the probabilities for an action are the sum of prior probabilities over actions (state/observation) for that action. Each choice corresponds to a single decision made by the agent with each observation.

2. **Randomization**: You can use a randomization scheme if you want the agents to move independently from each other or without influencing one another's preferences in future observations. You could also consider using a random sampling technique, where the probability distribution of the actions is generated randomly between 0 and 1 (inclusive) for each action chosen by the agent.

3. **Initialization**: You can initialize an initial policy density over all possible outcomes using dictionary-based inference protocols or storing them into a list of tuples ("policy", "action"). These policies encode choices that are executed based on their prior probabilities across actions.

4. **State and Observation Manipulations**: You could also use other features from the GNN representation, such as:
   - **History**: Each observation is encoded with an action-specific history which can be computed at each time step by storing the previous observables into a list of tuples ("history", "observation"). This allows you to compute and update a state sequence based on past states.
   - **Action Selection**: You could also use actions as parameters in a policy vector, so that for each observation, the probability distribution is computed over corresponding actions given prior probabilities across all actions specified by the choice of action.

5. **Initialization with Random History**: If you're using a Markov chain-based implementation and want to initialize an initial state sequence without any learning or history generation process in place at every time step, then you might consider implementing it directly as an instance from the GNN representation. However, this approach is not feasible because you would have to implement the action selection mechanism independently of the GNN representation.
Therefore, your understanding has been very comprehensive and clear about what's happening when using a GNN-based POMDP agent in simulation scenarios, so please provide more details on specific actions or decision transitions that are executed across observations for each observation if you'd like to continue discussing your thoughts further!
