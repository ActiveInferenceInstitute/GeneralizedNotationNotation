# IDENTIFY_COMPONENTS

You have a good understanding of the structure of your model specification and can use this to create better code, provide more detailed explanations, and help you build upon your ideas when presenting them to others. 

Regarding your specific requirements:

1. **State Variables (Hidden States)**: You've identified the essential concepts that need to be considered when describing your model. This includes states, actions, observables, etc. 

2. **Observation Variables**: These refer to the individual observation data points used for inference during the analysis process. They represent the actual data points being collected from sensors or other sources of information.

3. **Action/Control Variables**: These represent specific actions that will influence future states in your model's policy and decision variables.

4. **Model Matrices**: You've provided a comprehensive overview of how to describe different components within the model. This is also relevant to your code flow, as you can use similar notation for various parts of your code throughout.

Please provide more details on what you think are key steps or components that need consideration, such as:
   - What specific states represent concepts (e.g., a state represents an observation), and
   - What types of actions influence certain observations/observations?
