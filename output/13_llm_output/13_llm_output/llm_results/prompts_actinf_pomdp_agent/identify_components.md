# IDENTIFY_COMPONENTS

Based on the information in your document, you'll need to implement the following:

1. Implement Active Inference POMDP agent with four states and 3 hidden states (states/variables) for an unbounded time horizon with no depth-first search, deep planning, and hierarchical nesting policies.
   - Initialize state variable matrices A, B, C, D, F.

2. Implement GNN representations of POMDPs using parameters `C`, `F` and other parameters to represent each observation space (observations/variables).
   - Iterate through states by updating the corresponding action vector (`g`) based on a policy gradient.
3. Implement Bayesian inference with a probability distribution over actions to update the agent's beliefs (prior) at each state, using parameter `P` and other parameters for each belief variable and prior distributions.

4. Implement GNN representations of POMDPs using the learned probabilities and biases across states/observations in the transition matrix (`G`, etc.) to initialize the agent's actions as actions based on their probability distribution over previous state transitions.
5. Implement Bayesian inference with a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) that can capture uncertainty through prior distributions `B` and other parameters for each belief variable and prior distributions of prior beliefs, enabling the agent's preferences at each state/observation to be updated accordingly.

6. Implement POMDP agents using parameterization to represent each observation space across states/observations in the action vector (`g`) based on a policy distribution and prior probabilities `F` for each observable transition, allowing the agent's actions at each state to update their beliefs after each observation switch-off transitions (prior changes).
7. Implement GNN representations of POMDPs using the learned parameters (e.g., the transition matrix) to initialize the agents' states/observations and action choices as they observe each other, enabling the agent's preferences at each state/observation to be updated accordingly based on their prior probabilities for actions associated with each observed observation change.
8. Implement GNN representations of POMDPs using the learned parameters (e.g., the transition matrix) to initialize the agents' policies and action choices as they observe each other, enabling the agent's preferences at each state/observation to be updated based on their prior probabilities for actions associated with each observed observation change.
9. Implement GNN representations of POMDPs using the learned parameters (`F`) and other biases (e.g., the transition matrix) to initialize the agents' predictions and beliefs from observations, enabling the agent's preferences at each state/observation based on their prior probabilities for actions associated with each observed observation change through past states and action choices.
10. Implement GNN representations of POMDPs using a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) that can capture uncertainty by including an initial probability distribution over predictions, enabling the agent's beliefs at each state/observation based on their prior probabilities for actions associated with each observed observation change through past states and action choices.
11. Implement Bayesian inference with a probabilistic graphical model (`G`, etc.) to update the agent's beliefs at each state/observation based on current predictions of future observations, enabling the agent's preferences at each state/observation based on their prior probabilities for actions associated with each observed observation change through past states and action choices.
12. Implement GNN representations of POMDPs using a probabilistic graphical model (`G`, etc.) to initialize the agents' beliefs in terms of past predictions, enabling them to update as their observations provide new information based on probability distributions over recent actions (policy updates) at each state/observation.
