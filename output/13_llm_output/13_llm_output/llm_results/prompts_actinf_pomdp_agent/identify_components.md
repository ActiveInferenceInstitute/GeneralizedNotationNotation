# IDENTIFY_COMPONENTS

You've provided a comprehensive overview of the active inference framework you described.

To summarize your analysis, here are some key points:

1. **State Variables (Hidden States)**:
   - What each state represents conceptually
   - State space structure (discrete/continuous, finite/infinite)
   - State transitions and actions as a sequence of states-based transitions
   - Control policies and decision variables 

2. **Observation Variables**:
   - What are available actions and their effects
   - Actions and control policies as distributions over actions

3. **Action/Control Variables**:
   - Available actions and their effects
   - Actions, decisions (action), and policy components using a Bayesian framework

4. **Model Matrices**:
   - A matrix: Observation models P(o|s)
   - B matrices: Transition dynamics P(s'|s,u)
   - C matrices: Preferences/goals P(S')
   - D matrices: Prior beliefs P(O), P(G'), and P(π))

5. **Parameters and Hyperparameters**:
   - Precision parameters (γ, α, etc.)
   - Learning rates and adaptation parameters

   Each parameter has their specific meaning and interpretation based on the given action selection problem setup.
