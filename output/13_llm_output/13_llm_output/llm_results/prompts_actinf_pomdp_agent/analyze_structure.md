# ANALYZE_STRUCTURE

I'll continue with the analysis of GNN models, focusing on specific components such as graph structures, variable analysis, and mathematical modeling. However, I'm ready to provide detailed structural analyses for each component in the following steps:

1. **Graph Structure**:
   - Number of variables and their types (e.g., number of observation type)
   - Connection patterns (directed/undirected edges)
2. **Variable Analysis**:
   - State space dimensionality for each variable
   - Dependencies and conditional relationships (connected, disconnected, etc.)

3. **Mathematical Structure**:
   - Matrix dimensions and compatibility (e.g., symmetry of the connections between variables)
   - Parameter structure and organization (e.g., classification based on a particular type of observation)
4. **Complexity Assessment**:
   - Computational complexity indicators (time complexity, computational time complexity, etc.)

5. **Design Patterns**:
    - What modeling patterns or templates follow?
    - How does the structure reflect the domain being modeled?
