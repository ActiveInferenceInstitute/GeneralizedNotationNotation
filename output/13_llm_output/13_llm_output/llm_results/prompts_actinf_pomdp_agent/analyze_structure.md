# ANALYZE_STRUCTURE

I've taken a detailed look at the graph properties, variable analysis, and mathematical structures for your Active Inference POMDP agent example:

Let's dive deeper into some key aspects of the code.

1. **Graph Structure**: We can't directly access the graph structure or compute its properties because they are stored in variables ("LikelihoodMatrix", "TransitionMatrix"). However, we can analyze the variables that describe a state and make inferences about other states and actions.

2. **Variable Analysis**: We have an array of labeled inputs to each action selection, which may indicate some type of structure or mapping between actions and states:
- Actions are connected as directed edges (directed edge) with a variable label ("actions" in the code), so we can analyze that "outputs":
   - Outputs appear along the left-most axis of graph structure. 
   - In general, outputs seem to have categorical labels such as "action", but they don't necessarily follow a particular path or mechanism (e.g., "action") like output nodes in a directed graph.

3. **Mathematical Structure**: The Graph Structure variable represents the overall state space of all states and actions: 
   - This structure is a grid-like domain with vertices labeled by action, which may indicate some type of hierarchical mapping between actions and states. 

4. **Variable Analysis**: We have an array of labeled inputs to each action selection (represented as "outputs") and can analyze these using variables ("actions"):
   - Actions appear along the left-most axis of graph structure; in general, outputs seem to be categorical labels such as "action", but they don't necessarily follow a particular path or mechanism.

5. **Mathematical Structure**: The Variable Analysis variable is annotated with the type of input (outputs), which allows us to evaluate its validity and potential behavior based on the action selection pattern:
   - This property can help detect patterns in the graph structure that may reflect specific actions. For example, if an agent selects a particular action, there should be at least one output directed edge for that action.

6. **Design Patterns**: The Graph Structure variable serves as a blueprint or template to generate possible actions based on the input inputs and predictions about their behavior:
   - This allows us to define specific actions (outputs) in terms of potential outcomes/actions, which can be further analyzed using variables ("outputs"). 

7. **Complexity Assessment**: We've found that the graph structure exhibits some sort of hierarchical mapping between actions and states, where each action corresponds to a specific path or mechanism:
   - This suggests that we should evaluate this graph structure based on its properties and complexity characteristics (i.e., its structure) rather than just the output values.

8. **Design Patterns**: The Variable Analysis variable is annotated with the type of input ("outputs"), which allows us to evaluate its validity and potential behavior based on the action selection pattern:
   - This evaluation can help identify patterns or behaviors, which may indicate specific actions (e.g., "action") that are likely to lead to a particular outcome/decision-making process.

Let's summarize our findings for the graph structure analysis and variable analysis part of your code.

In conclusion, this code provides access to the graph structure and allows us to evaluate possible actions based on potential outcomes (outputs). This helps identify patterns or behaviors in the graph structure that may indicate specific actions leading to a particular outcome/decision-making process.
