# ANALYZE_STRUCTURE

Let's break down the structure of the GNN specification and its analysis to understand how it fits within the broader framework of Active Inference POMDPs. Here are some key insights:

1. **Graph Structure**: The graph represented by the variables `A`, `B` represent the state space dimensionality (num_hidden_states) and node types (`S`) in a GNN representation model.

2. **Variable Analysis**: The variable `F` is a habit, which can be modeled as an action-based distribution over actions, with two types of connections:
   - One connected to the agent's policy and action using the agent's prior probability vector (policy posterior). This indicates that the pattern sequence is generated by applying specific policies.
   - The other connected to the graph structure itself (the habit), which can be modeled as an instance-based distribution over actions.

3. **Mathematical Structure**: The model consists of two main types of graphs:
   - A directed graph representing a state space dimensionality `num_hidden_states` and directionally linked variables (`S`) for each variable (`A`, `B`, etc.). This allows us to represent the behavior of the agent in terms of its action sequence.
   - An undirected, connected graph structure representing the set of actions (permutations). Each action is associated with a subset of states-independent transitions and observations that are used as inputs for inference operations. The permutation connections allow the agent's preferences to be encoded through probability distributions over the actions it takes.

4. **Complexity Assessment**: Understanding how the structure reflects the domain being modeled can help in designing more realistic modeling models or extracting insights into the underlying mechanisms.

Some key principles of this framework:
   - **Directed graph representation** implies a hierarchical, network-based model where agents and actions are embedded within graphs with directed edges connected by transition matrices. This allows for accurate inference based on pattern sequences generated from agent's prior probabilities.
   - **Graph structure**: The directionality of the vertices indicates whether or not to use action sequences as inputs for the GNN predictions. For instance, in a permutation representation (one-step sequence), where actions are associated with set-wise transitions and observation outcomes have independent paths through nodes, an agent's preference preferences will be encoded in these directed edges.
   - **Permutation graph structure**: The connections between adjacent nodes imply that actions can serve as inputs for prediction operations based on a specific policy. This allows for the use of information from previous states to learn new patterns. For example, if we are predicting the next state's motion, agent A might select an action in its history, and then infer more specific future actions.
   - **Directed graph representation**: The structure reflects the dependence between actions (permutations) on the policy used for inference operations and can thus be represented as directed edges connecting states to transitions over actions. This allows for prediction based solely on a single-step sequence of actions rather than an entire path in time, which might lead to lower predictions or a higher probability that the same action will have been taken multiple times due to prior knowledge about previous steps.

By understanding how these components interact and relate one another, we can generate more realistic models within this framework, allowing for better generalization of findings from our analysis without relying on oversimplification in our modeling efforts.
