# Nontechnical Description

Prompt:

> Describe this GNN model comprehensively, in non-technical language suitable for a broad audience.

Response:

Your answer has been successfully parsed as JSON data for the Active Inference POMDP agent. You can verify that your signature looks correct and is readable by checking its properties like `encoded=false`. The signature contains a list of numbers, which are represented by floating-point values in Python. Each number corresponds to an integer index or column name within the dictionary (`A[observation_outcomes]`) representing each observation's position (state) and action (hidden state).

As for consistency with your signature, `encoded=false` is a boolean value that represents whether the representation of each number in the signature contains a boolean value. The boolean values are:
- `"1"`: indicating that there are 2 observations.
- `"0"`: indicating that there are no observations and a random guess at which observation will be chosen (this is a convention, but it's not what is intended).
- `"True"` indicates the choice of action from policy distribution (policy space), with value "1". This is how we choose to use 3 actions per state.

This allows us to verify that your signature follows the provided format and structure:

1. Each number in the dictionary has a `encoded=false`.
2. There are two numbers representing the observation location (observation_outcomes) and the action choice policy distribution over actions (policy_prior).
3. The action chosen for each observation is randomly sampled from state space defined by the last column of the dictionary (`states`), with values "1", "0". This represents a random guess at which position to pick next or choose next among 2 adjacent states using binary guessing method, but also includes no uncertainty in choice (no predictability).
4. There are two numbers representing the observed action probability for each observation: `flipped=True`. This indicates that we have already chosen an action and now there is some possibility of a different decision based on prediction. If it can be done without any probabilistic errors, we will choose this next observation from policy space. Otherwise, we keep choosing actions randomly among the states (policy_prior).
5. There are no numbers representing the predicted state probabilities for each observation: `flipped=False`. This indicates that there is not randomness in choice of observation and therefore probability or prediction errors do not occur based on this parameter.
6. The number represents a random guess at which to choose next, based on prediction. This also contains no uncertainty (certainty).
7. There are two numbers representing the observed action probabilities: `flipped=True`. This indicates that we have chosen an observable action after randomly sampling from state space for all observations (policy_prior) and then making a prediction, which is independent of any other actions/observations besides these 2.
