# SUMMARIZE_CONTENT

Here's a concise overview of what the GNN Section contains:

1. **Model Overview**: A summary of the Model Overview with key variables (hidden states), observations, actions/controls, action selection rules (`F` and `G`), discovery horizon (Unbounded), planning horizon ($t$), planning scope ($num_hidden_states$, $num_actions$, $numberOfActions`, $modelParameters**(1-3)`), and critical parameters.

2. **Key Variables**: Detailed descriptions of the variables, including their roles (`A`) and how they relate to each other in the GNN Representation (variables with brief descriptions).

3. **Critical Parameters**: Key parameter sets:
   - `hidden_states`: List containing key variables
   - `num_observations`: List indicating the number of observations
   - `num_actions`): List describing actions/controls

   The key parameters are described in the document's content and can be accessed using a dictionary comprehension. For instance, `nObservations` is specified as `(3)`.

4. **Notable Features**: Important subsets for specific scenarios or applications:
   - **Special properties** (e.g., “hidden states” and “actions/controls”)

   This feature sets are described in the document's content and can be accessed using a dictionary comprehension, e.g., `[``(1)`.*)`

5. **Use Cases**: What scenarios would apply this model to?

Note that these sections do not contain any specific mathematical notation or definitions for variables, parameters (functions), or critical parameters but provide concise summaries with links to additional information related to the specific modeling concepts described in the document's content.
