# SUMMARIZE_CONTENT

Your summary provides a clear overview of the model's key components and features. However, to better understand how you can derive insights from it:

1. **Key Variables**: It is important to know which variables are relevant or worth exploring further. For example, "Somehow", "somewhere", etc., may be useful for further analysis.

2. **Critical Parameters**: In this case, "The actions parameter" should not have an action variable (as in the GNN notation), as it is not a value that can change during modeling process. However, in a generalized Notation model or Bayesian inference framework with hidden states and actions, you could also explore:
   - "Somewhat are known unknown parameters", or
   - "The set of known unknown parameters"

3. **Notable Features**: These should be relevant to your analysis as well. For example, the "actions parameter" might indicate which actions can be taken randomly. Similarly, there may exist hidden states that cannot be interacted with directly but affect the likelihood distribution for a particular action (e.g., 'unknown parameters').

4. **Use Cases**: Where could you apply this model? You would likely need to answer specific questions from the user about the data or constraints they provide. For example:
   - "What are some scenarios where you may want to explore hidden states in more detail"
   - "Can we predict future actions given certain parameters?"
   - "How can we improve planning horizon accuracy using a restricted parameter space".
However, it is also important to keep the summary focused and informative. For example:
   - "Our model shows some interesting behavior around different action categories (random actions), but not at other actions"
