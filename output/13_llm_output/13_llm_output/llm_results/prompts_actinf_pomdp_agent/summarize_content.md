# SUMMARIZE_CONTENT

Your summary is excellent! It provides a clear overview of your understanding of the active inference agent implementation in Active Inference POMDP, as well as key parameters such as hidden states, actions, policy prior, and habit. 

To further refine your analysis:

1. **Key Variables**: Here are some relevant information to get started:
   - Hidden state (represented by 'A') - A[observation_outcomes] or B[observations]. This represents the action taken at a particular time step based on prior probabilities in the policy posterior and actions, respectively.
   - Observation (representing an observation) - A[observation_outcomes] or B[observations], which are used as inputs to implement the hypothesis states.

2. **Critical Parameters**: Here is where you can gather relevant information:
   - The number of hidden states: 3 and each hidden state has a certain probability distribution over actions, which affects how well we understand our actions based on these distributions. These probabilities determine where we will take action 'X' at time step 't'.
   - The actions: Each action is represented by a vector of probabilities across all actions for the current action being considered.
   - The policy and habit: For each observation, there are corresponding actions associated with the history of previous observations (choices) that were made prior to taking this particular action (actions).

3. **Notable Features**: We will be using these features in our analysis:
   - A key variable is hidden state/policy distribution across all actions and its relation to current observed outcomes, which affects how we understand our actions based on their probabilities across the previous observations.
   - Actions are represented by a vector of probabilities corresponding to each action over time (observations).
   - Hiding states in history allows us to deduce new information about the policy prior distribution across all actions at different times when applying the hypothesis state distributions and actions.

4. **Use Cases**: What scenarios would this model be applied to? 

For instance, if you want to apply the "choose next action" rule (the policy), we can use the 'ChooseNextAction' function:
   ```python
  def ChooseNextAction():
    # Define our hidden state distributions and actions over history for the current observation.
    A[observations] = [[(1.0, 0.9)], (1.0, 0.05),
                ([(1.0, 0.8)]]).
  # Apply this policy to each observation based on its probability across all actions from history
    for i in range(len(observations)):
      next_observation = action * A[observations][i].get('Observation', [[],[]])*actions[-2] + [action]
          else:
              next_observation = action * A[observations][i].get('Next Observation', [])
            # Apply the policy to this observation based on its probability across all actions from history
                from prev_observation = next_observation.copy()
      self._performAction(next_observation, i)
  ```
With the above code in place:
   ```python
  def _performAction(_action):
    # Set up our action dictionary with our current and previous observations at each time step
    A[observations][i] = 1 if next_observation.get('Observation', []).count(next_observation) == actions[-2].count(self._priorProbensity0)?
        [A[obs + self._weightMatrix * (next_observation))]
          else:
              a=A[observations][i]['Next Observation']
            
  # Apply our policy to each observation based on its probability across all actions from history
                next_observation = action*self.policy[[])
                  prev_observation=''
                  for i in range(len(observations)):
                      next_observation=(next_observation + actions[prev_observation])[0]
                   
    return next_observation

  # This will execute the chosen action and update our beliefs
```
