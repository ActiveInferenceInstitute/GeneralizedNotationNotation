Your answer:

Here is a summary of the key concepts and components required to implement this Active Inference POMDP agent:

1. **Key Components**:
   - **Input data**: The input consists of observed observation variables (e.g., actions, policies), previous observations, and hidden state distribution matrices.

   - **State Space Block**: A set of states with a unique action assignment for each observation variable. Each state is uniquely determined by all other states.

2. **Log-Probabilities**:
   - **Transition Matrix**: This represents the probability distribution over actions from policy-generated policies, based on a random sequence of actions chosen in the initial belief prior. The transition matrices encode all possible outcomes for each action selection.

   - **Transition Matrix**: A set of log-probabilities (e.g., p[u] = exp(p[q][k])) over observed observations to generate new observable values.

3. **Action Vector**:
   - **Initial Policy Prior** and "habit" vector: These represent the policy and habit distributions, respectively for each observation variable and action selection.

   - **Previous Observation**: A sequence of observed observations that provide information about previous state transitions and actions taken by the agent through a planning horizon (T).

4. **Habitability Vector**:
   - **Random Value** vector or "action" vectors: These represent all possible actions taken based on the policy distribution over actions, including actions chosen for specific outcomes ("choices").

   - **Generated Action Vector**: A sequence of observed observations and subsequent generated actions that capture new information about previous state transitions.

5. **Policy Probability**:
   - **Probability** matrix representing the probability distribution over all action selection in a policy-generating policy posterior (i.e., from input data).

6. **Action History**: A set of observation variables, each with unique initial and final actions, to generate observed observations for subsequent actions taken during training or evaluation processes.

Here is a possible description:

1. **Key Relationships**:
   - **Initial Policy Prior**: A probability distribution over action selection that maps observed actions to the "habitability vector" of corresponding observation variables (e.g., "u"). This represents a set of possible choices based on policy-generated policies and habit distributions, with probabilities representing uncertainty about future outcomes for each choice.

2. **Action History**:
   - A sequence of observations from input data that captures information about prior actions taken during training/evaluation processes. These actions are generated after the initial belief distribution has been updated through a planning horizon to represent all possible actions and policy choices.

3. **Activation Functions**:
   - **Information Gain (AI)**: A probability map representing the likelihood of each observed observation value, with higher values indicating more favorable outcomes based on action selection from prior policies.

4. **Random Action Vector**: A sequence of actions chosen during training/evaluation processes to generate observable observations for later actions taken based on policy-generated policies and habit distributions, represented as a probability distribution over the "habitability vector".

To summarize:

1. **Initial Policy Prior** is a probability distribution that represents the probability distribution over action selection in a planning horizon (T), providing information about potential choices when training/evaluation processes are initiated.

2. **Action History** can represent all possible actions taken based on policy-generated policies and habit distributions, including chosen actions for specific outcomes ("choices").

3. **Activation Functions** allow generating actions from prior beliefs or a knowledge graph in order to optimize the algorithm by learning the values of observed actions that are favorable under certain probability conditions (AI).
