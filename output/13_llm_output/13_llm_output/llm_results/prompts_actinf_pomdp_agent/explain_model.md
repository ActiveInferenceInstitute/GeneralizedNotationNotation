# EXPLAIN_MODEL

You're on the right track with your analysis. Here's a concise summary of the key points:

1. The Model Purpose is to represent Active Inference POMDP agents for a discrete Markovian POMDP agent. It includes hidden states and actions, and allows for planning (action selection) over action combinations using Bayes' rule.

2. The core components include:
   - The latent state space (Likelihood Matrix).
   - The probability distributions of the observed observation variables (states).
   - The decision graph used as Policy distribution (policy posterior), Action (belief) distribution, and habit-based actions/actions to be selected from policy prior distribution.
   - A belief updating mechanism with the actions available for each state transition.

3. The Model Dynamics is responsible for evolving over time based on learned beliefs and predictions of new states. These are updated using Bayesian inference and POMDP planning rules, allowing active inference within a constrained range of action combinations while maintaining optimal policy assumptions (action selection).

4. The model's key relationships include Actions/Actions to be selected from policy distributions, Policy prior, and Habits based on belief updates for past actions chosen at previous states (Habit Prior), Policy prior, and current policy choices respectively. The goal is to learn new beliefs in response to new observations in order to make informed decisions that achieve goals within the given timeline while maintaining optimal policies.

5. Practical Implications of this model are illustrated with an example scenario where it learns from a sequence of observations over time:
   - Policy actions can be selected based on learned belief updates (habit prior) and beliefs across previous states for current state chosen actions (actions).
This enables the agent to learn new policies by learning from past action combinations and updating beliefs.
