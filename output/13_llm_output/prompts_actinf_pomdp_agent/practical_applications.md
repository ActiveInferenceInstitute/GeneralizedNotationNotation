# PRACTICAL_APPLICATIONS

In summary, here are key points about GNN models:
1. The model is designed to provide a structured representation of an FPM (Functional Predictive Model) with various actions and histories on the state space (states). Each action has 3 possible outcomes (`observation`, `hidden state`), each history contains probabilities over the next states, and so forth. These are represented as matrix-vector multiplies from the layers to form the model structure.
2. The model provides a graphical description of actions used in FPMs, with an initial policy distribution (policy vector) that has information on available resources for action selection ($\phi$), and also prior distributions over observed states ("preference" vectors). These are represented as matrices. For each observation $x$, the history contains probabilities for each possible next state $(b_{u(n)}_i)$ given previous policy (policy vector), and also an initial preference distribution over observable paths ($\phi_{a(n)})$ from which each action can be chosen).
3. The model is flexible, allowing for exploration of a wide range of data points using both sequential and multi-step reasoning approaches. It is capable to detect certain types of patterns in the observed outcomes, including:
    - Regularities (similarity among actions across observations)
    - Patterns related to prior distributions over observable paths 
    - Patterns indicating that an observation may not be used by previous agents
4. The model provides a graphical representation for FPMs with specific actions and histories on states, allowing for optimization of action selection based on the available information from the history (`actions`) plus inference of future observations (observation) based solely upon the history (`prior`). 
5. It can handle different data types simultaneously, as well as varying degrees of complexity in representing FPMs or other models using various graph structures and symbolic representations.
6. The model is able to provide insights into specific problems such as identifying patterns in data when actions are not used by previous agents ($\phi_{a(n)})$), predicting the likelihood of an action's occurrence based on prior distributions over observed states, etc.
7. It can be implemented using various methods for representing models and providing visualizations, including tabular representations (sequences to columns from layers), vectorized representation, graph structures and graphical notation, etc. 
8. These models are scalable and adaptable to changing data types and configurations across different domains using an appropriate framework or library.
9. They can be effectively integrated with other systems that require a structured representation of FPMs including machine learning based frameworks for modeling FPM-based decision trees (MID), neural networks, Bayesian models etc.
