# PRACTICAL_APPLICATIONS

Let's delve into the implementation aspects of your GNN application:

1. **Implementation Considerations**:
	* **Computational requirements and scalability**: This model requires computational resources, which can be costly to implement. You may need to explore various resource-intensive architectures or compute environments that could potentially consume a significant portion of these resources. Some frameworks might prioritize using specific computation tools, such as GPUs for CPU computations, while others might rely on external hardware infrastructure like TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) and specialized accelerators.

2. **Performance Expectations**:
	* **Type of GNN model**: You're interested in applying to different applications based upon the type of GNN representation you have. You can choose between a Bayesian GNN for training, a GCN GN distribution modeling on hidden state distributions, or an Active Inference POMDP agent.

3. **Implementation Considerations**:
	* **Model evaluation metrics**: Your goal is to evaluate your model against specific performance criteria like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (f2), mean square error, etc. You can choose from various evaluation frameworks for inference algorithms based on the type of GNN models you have chosen.

4. **Benefits and Advantages**:
	* **Key features**: This model is designed to solve problems with specific requirements like predictions, hypothesis testing, estimation, or classification accuracy in real-time across a wide range of domains. Its key capabilities include planning horizon (1 step), prediction horizon (infinite time period), decision boundary performance analysis, and ensemble learning (ensemble generalization).

5. **Implementation Considerations**:
	* **Data quality and availability**: Your data collection strategy will determine how you can optimize your model for efficient computation and scalability in terms of computational resources and storage capacity. This may involve leveraging specialized databases or distributed systems to provide access to large amounts of training data.

6. **Debugging and Analysis**:
	* **Error detection metrics**: You'll need measures that track errors encountered during inference, such as accuracy-based metrics like F1+score/Precision-area (FP)/AreaUnderAxes or mean absolute error(MAE). There may be specific requirements for data quality issues to handle in terms of schema generation and integration with existing systems.

7. **Data Visualization and Exploration**: You can explore various visualization approaches based on your choice of implementation, including plots showcasing predictions across different time frames, data distributions, and exploration of potential error patterns within the GNN model itself. 

Now that we have a better understanding of the application requirements, let's move forward with our analysis for modeling specific domain applications in terms of performance, computational resources, and integration capabilities with existing systems.
