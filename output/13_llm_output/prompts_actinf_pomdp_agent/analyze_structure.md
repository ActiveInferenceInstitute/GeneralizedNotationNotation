# ANALYZE_STRUCTURE

Based on your description, here's a structured analysis of the active inference POMDP agent and its components:

1. **Graph Structure**:
This is one of the main areas to focus upon in this analysis. The graph represents the data flow path between the different variables, enabling us to identify patterns and connections within the graph structure. We'll also explore how the variable relationships are structured into networks based on dependencies (state transitions) and conditional relationships (actions taken).

2. **Variable Analysis**:
We've already explored this topic in the GNN section where we analyzed the graphs for variable types, connection pattern identification, etc. For now, let's focus on identifying what type of graph structure is present within the agent. The key insight here is that there are not many different variables and their connections can be seen as a result of a hierarchical representation (states-actions).

3. **Mathematical Structure**:
This analysis explores how the structure reflects domain dependencies, special properties, or complexity considerations for different frameworks/frameworks being modeled. For instance, we've discussed that using Variational Inference models helps to identify graphs with high level connections between variables and those with complex patterns of relationships within the graph.

4. **Complexity Assessment**:
This analysis assesses how the structure is composed into a variety of graphs depending on specific model inputs/outputs (parameters). This can be done by analyzing the relationships among different components based on their dependence on each other, as well as looking at how they interact and communicate with one another within that graph.

5. **Design Patterns**:
The analysis involves identifying common patterns across different models in terms of graphs structure (variables) and their associated connections between them. This is also explored through the use of Symmetry-based modeling (SM), which can help simplify complex graphs into a single, unified representation. This pattern helps identify how components are connected to each other within that graph structure.
