# IDENTIFY_COMPONENTS

Here are the steps in the provided code:

1. **State Variable Representations**: The `cryptographic signature` represents a specific signature of an object (e.g., an ID) represented by a set of state variables. Each state variable represents its identity and can be used for prediction or decision-making purposes within the context of the given GNN code.

2. **Observation Variables**: There are two types of observations, which allow the agent to interact with the network:
   - `observations`: A collection of observation variables that track the actions taken during each timestep and provide additional information about where they have been placed within the space represented by the network (e.g., state transitions). Each observation can be thought of as a tuple containing:
    - Observation coordinates

    - Inputs to sequence encoder/decoder pairs

3. **Action Variables**: There are three types of actions, which allow the agent to change or implement its own preferences in the given GNN code ("action selection") for action classification and decision-making purposes within the context of the provided algorithm (e.g., "policy"). The actions can be thought as a sequence of transitions from previous states to next states with respect to different initial state parameters. Each action is represented by a vector containing:
    - Action variable (default)

    - Probability distribution over actions

4. **Model Variables**: There are three types of model variables that represent the agent's preferences and decisions within the context of GNN (e.g., "belief") for policy initialization, estimation, and prediction purposes in the provided algorithm ("policy"). Each belief vector is represented by a sequence of vectors containing:
    - Forward probability distribution over actions

    - Backward probability distribution over states

5. **Parameters**: There are three types of parameters that represent the actions (actions) of the agent within the context of GNN (e.g., "action selection") and control policies for policy initialization, estimation, and prediction purposes in the provided algorithm ("policy"). Each parameter is represented by a sequence of vectors containing:
    - Initialization value

    - Cost distribution over action selections

6. **Hyperparameters**: There are three types of hyperparameters that describe the behavior of GNN within the context of GNN (e.g., "precision") and enable optimization for prediction purposes in the provided algorithm ("learning rates"). Each parameter is represented by a sequence of vectors containing:
    - Initialization value

    - Constant values used to optimize learning rate

7. **Temporal Structure**: There are three types of temporal structures that describe the time-varying behavior of GNN within the context of GNN (e.g., "time") and enable optimization for prediction purposes in the provided algorithm ("prediction"). Each temporal structure is represented by a sequence of vectors containing:
    - Initialization value

    - Constraints representing action selections from policy sequences

8. **Sequence Encoder/Decoder**: There are three types of sequence encoders/decoders that represent different actions and policies within GNN (e.g., "policy") for prediction purposes in the provided algorithm ("prediction"). Each sequence encoder represents a specific state-action combination for each action selection from policy sequences, where:
    - Forward probability distribution over actions

    - Backward probability distribution over states

9. **Optimization**: There are three types of optimization strategies that enable optimization for prediction purposes in GNN (e.g., "learning rate") and enable the exploration and validation process within the context of GNN ("learnable parameters"). Each optimizer represents a different policy and action selection, where:
    - Initialization value

    - Constant values used to optimize learning rate

10. **Randomized Estimation**: There are three types of randomization strategies that allow generating new sequences from existing ones for prediction purposes in the provided algorithm ("learning rates") or enable updating parameters within GNN (e.g., "bias-to-variance" strategy) and enabling exploration and validation of GNN models within the context of GNN ("hyperparameters"). Each randomization strategy is represented by a sequence of vectors containing:
    - Initialization value

    - Constant values used to optimize learning rate

11. **Optimized Estimation**: There are three types of optimized estimation strategies that enable generating new sequences from existing ones for prediction purposes in the provided algorithm (e.g., "bias-to-variance" strategy) and enabling exploration and validation of GNN models within the context of GNN ("hyperparameters") and enabling evaluation with a particular type of probability distribution (see section "Hyperparameter Selection")
You are correct that there is another signature represented by `cryptographic signature` which represents an ID.
