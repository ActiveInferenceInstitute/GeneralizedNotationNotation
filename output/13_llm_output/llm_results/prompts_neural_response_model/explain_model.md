# EXPLAIN_MODEL

You've already completed the list of components mentioned for the Active Inference Neural Response Model v1 (see the end of the document). Here's a summary and additional comments:

**Overview**: This model represents active inference by capturing essential aspects of neural computation, including how neurons respond to stimuli using Active Inference principles. It includes several key components:

1. **Introduction**: A comprehensive introduction explaining what the model can do (model purpose) and describing its core components (hidden states (s_f0, s_f1, etc.), observations, actions, controls, policy, behavior types).
2. **Constraints**: A description of how the model operates within its domain knowledge base using active inference principles:
   - **Active Inference Principle**: A detailed explanation of what happens when applied to a specific scenario or problem.
   
   - **Model Purpose**: An overview of what this mechanism does and what it represents, along with key relationships between different components.

3. **Key Interactions**: A description of how the model interacts with other mechanisms (actions/controls) based on its understanding of the underlying systems/regimelts:
   - **Connection Structure**: A clear explanation of how the model learns, updates models, and uses interactions to improve performance.
   
**Details**: There are several key components in the Model Purpose section:

1. **Generalized Linear Model (GLM)**: A detailed description for the GLMM algorithm used in this implementation, along with a step-by-step explanation of how it works.

    - `G(θ)' = (λ' * θ**2 + α*d') / d**2`
   - `G(a_0', b_1) = [x]^T x[t]*b_{t+1} + (x)^T x[t-1] a_(t-1)*a_[t] + ...`

2. **Neural Network Representation**: An overview of how the neural network acts using Active Inference principles:
   - `N(θ)' = {D * G^n(g)}`.
   
   - `G(x, y) = x[0]*y***a_{t-1} + (x)^T x[t] a_(t-1)*b_2 *a_[t+1]`

3. **Model Updates**: A detailed explanation of how the model updates its beliefs based on new data, including the update rules and relationships between different components:
   - `d*** = D*'`.
   
   - `φ(θ, t) = [x_0 + g * d'] / (1-g)**2`.
   
4. **Action Types**: A description of how actions/controls are used to make decisions based on the current data:
   - `A(f***)' = {a}`

This is just a basic outline, and more detailed understanding can be gained through additional resources or sources, such as references within the documentation document.
