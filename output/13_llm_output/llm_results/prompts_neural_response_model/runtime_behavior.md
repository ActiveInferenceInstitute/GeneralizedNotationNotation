# Runtime Behavior

Prompt:

> Describe what happens when this GNN model runs and how it would behave in different settings or domains.

Response:

Here's a simple example of an OpenAI MarketPlace Neural Network with some examples:
```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List

def neuralNetwork(input_size=(32, 3)):
    """
    This is a function to represent an open AI market place network.

    Parameters:
    input_size (tuple): A tuple of integers representing the total number of observations in the market place network.

    Returns:
    None
    """
    def layer():
        # Define initial state for the network
        states = [input_size[0] * 2, input_size[1], 45698 + (input_size[0]*3)]
        
        return randomState(randomize=False)
    
    return LayerModel.loadModelFromFile("../weights/layer-model.pb")
```
