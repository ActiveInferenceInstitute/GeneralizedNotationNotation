This is a comprehensive and scientifically rigorous implementation of Active Inference Neural Response model v1. It covers all key parameters, critical features, and use cases that would be useful in understanding the active inference mechanism underlying neural computations. The structure consists of Key Variables (A, B, C, D) with role descriptions for modeling neurons, actions/controls, observation connections, and state transition matrices respectively. Critical Parameters include key variables such as hidden states, actions(state transitions), and control parameters. Use Cases are specific to this model's design. This is a great example of active inference in action-based neural models, where it serves as the foundation for understanding how neural computation works with neurons modeling.
