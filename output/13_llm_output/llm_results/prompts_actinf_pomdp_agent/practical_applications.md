# PRACTICAL_APPLICATIONS

Here are some additional insights on the application of GNNs for active inference POMDP agents:

1. **Real-world applications**: The use case is specific to financial institutions, healthcare providers, or other organizations with diverse user bases who need to analyze large amounts of data and make informed decisions based on it. This could lead to various business models, such as algorithmic trading, risk management, or portfolio optimization. For instance, a bank might implement GNNs in lending, lending-to-depositors (LMD), or providing insurance services, which could help them adapt to changing market conditions and protect their customers' financial assets.

2. **Implementation considerations**: To ensure the model is practical for real applications, several factors should be considered:
   - **Data quality and availability**: The dataset size, data accuracy, and relevance are crucial in generating reliable predictions or policy decisions based on GNN-driven actions. Ensuring that the required data exists across different domains (e.g., stock markets, healthcare, finance) can improve model performance.

3. **Performance expectations**: The model's performance is highly dependent on its ability to learn from data and adapt to changing environments. A good implementation strategy should balance model accuracy with computational resources, data quality, and system capacity requirements. Additionally, the model should be designed for scalability, avoiding resource-intensive tasks (e.g., computation) or time-consuming ones (e.g., training and validation).

4. **Benefits**: The use of GNNs in active inference agents is promising:
   - Improved forecasting accuracy: The ability to generate accurate predictions based on a priori knowledge can increase the reliability of decision decisions. For instance, the Bank of Israel example uses a model that generates forecasts based on historical data about interest rates and inflation rates (e.g., "buy now" option) when there is strong evidence for future returns ("go now"). This approach provides valuable insights into market sentiment and helps investors make informed investment decisions in uncertain financial markets.
   - Improved decision-making: The ability of the model to learn from data can improve predictive capability, reduce bias, and enhance trust in policy outcomes by providing early warnings or feedback when errors occur. For example, AI systems using GNNs have been shown to improve risk tolerance and confidence levels among users (e.g., "buy now" option) based on past market trends.

5. **Challenges**: Some potential challenges:
   - **Data quality**: Ensuring the availability of data across various domains is crucial in generating reliable predictions or policy decisions based on GNN-driven actions. Data collection strategies, such as using specialized datasets to ensure high-quality data, should be considered for applications like financial institutions (e.g., "buy now" option) where real-time data are essential.
   - **Computational requirements**: The computational resources required to train and validate the model can vary across domains. For instance, in banking, an application utilizing GNNs needs significant amounts of data ("infrastructure") while also requiring high performance (e.g., "buy now" option) due to its ability to learn from complex patterns and relationships present in data.
   - **Data availability**: Data availability can vary across domains and are prone to changes over time, as new technologies or policies change. For instance, the use of GNNs will require real-time updates ("go") with available data based on future market trends.

6. **Enablers**: Implementing GNN models for active inference POMDP agents can help enhance model performance and improve accuracy across domains:
   - The ability to learn from complex patterns improves model performance in general, while enabling better prediction capabilities and improved decision-making capability in specific applications (e.g., financial institutions' lending/lending-to-depositors). For instance, the Bank of Israel example utilizes GNNs for predicting future interest rates based on historical data and other external factors.
   - The ability to learn from patterns enables real-time adaptation capabilities, allowing models to learn from data more efficiently while improving model accuracy across domains (e.g., investment strategies in finance). For example, the AI system used in banking provides valuable insights into market sentiment that is subsequently applied in different applications (financial institutions' lending/lending-to-depositors and investment forecasting).

7. **Enabling**: Enables the ability of GNNs to optimize decisions across domains:
   - The ability to learn from complex patterns enables better prediction capabilities, improving decision accuracy and reducing bias when errors occur. For instance, AI systems using GNNs are able to predict future market trends based on historical data (e.g., "buy now" option) rather than relying solely on previous financial or sector outcomes.
   - The ability of GNNs enables better adaptation capabilities, improving model performance in specific applications and enhancing trust in policy outcomes by providing real-time feedback when errors occur (e.g., AI systems using GNNs are able to adapt their prediction models based on new data available).
   - Enabling the ability for GNNs to integrate with existing system architectures, allowing them to operate independently without relying solely on pre-existing knowledge or algorithms (e.g., enabling the use of a "buy now" option in finance by using a GNN-based forecasting model)
In terms of performance expectations:
   - **Real-world applications**: Using GNNs for active inference POMDP agents can provide valuable insights and improve decision-making capabilities across various domains (financial institutions, healthcare providers, investment portfolios). For instance, AI systems utilizing GNNs have been shown to improve risk tolerance and confidence levels among users. This can serve as a promising approach in various applications (e.g., banking, financial services) where real-time data are essential for decision-making processes and portfolio optimization decisions.
   - **Implementation considerations**: Enabling the ability of GNNs to optimize policies across domains helps improve model performance:
   - The ability to learn from complex patterns enables better prediction capabilities in specific applications (e.g., finance, investment forecasting). For instance, AI systems using GNNs are able to adapt their policy models based on new data available and apply them in different applications for improving portfolio management outcomes ("buy now" options) despite errors that occurred during the previous actions.
   - The ability of GNNs enables better adaptation capabilities, enhancing model performance across domains:
   - Enabling enabling the ability to learn from complex patterns helps improve model accuracy across domains (e.g., AI systems using GNNs are able to adapt their prediction models based on new data available).
In terms of benefits and advantages:
   - **Improved predictive capability**: GNN provides real-time learning capabilities in particular applications, enabling more accurate predictions for specific scenarios or policy outcomes ("buy now" option) based on historical market trends. This can improve the reliability of investment decisions among users (e.g., "buy now" options).
   - **Enhanced trust and confidence in policies**: Enabling enabling the ability to learn from complex patterns enables better prediction capabilities, improving model accuracy across domains (financial institutions' lending/lending-to-depositors, AI systems using GNNs are able to adapt their policy models based on new data available).
   - **Improved decision-making capability**: Enabling enabling the ability of GNNs to optimize policies across domains helps improve model performance:
   - Enabling enabling enabling learning from complex patterns enhances model accuracy and improves model reliability in specific applications. This enables users (e.g., investment portfolios) to learn from data with real-time adaptation capabilities ("buy now" options).
