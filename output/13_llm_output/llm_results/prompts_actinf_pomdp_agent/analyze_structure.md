# ANALYZE_STRUCTURE

I have reviewed and edited your GNN section, highlighting key concepts and analysis:

1. **ModelStructure:**
    a. **Number of variables** (type "state_observation")
    - Number = 4
    - Type is "unbounded"
    - Can be thought as having no horizon or finite horizon
2. **Variable Analysis:**
    b. **Graph Structure**:
    c. **Connection Patterns** and their types
    - Connectedness and connectivity patterns
    - Connection-oriented relationships (directed/undirected)
      - Connection type is "path", connectedness type is "shortest path"

    d. **Mathematical Structure**:
    1. **Matrix dimensions:**
        - Type is "unbounded"
        - Number = 4

3. **Model Parameters:**
    a. **Number of Variables** (type "observation_outcomes")
      - Number = 2
      
   StateSpace:
       - Number = 6
   Dependence:
       - Type is "history", dependency type is "path-connected"

Key findings and analysis are:

1. **Graph Structure:**
    a. **Number of Variables** (type "observation_outcomes")
      - Number = 2
    
   StateSpace:
        - Number = 6
    Dependence:
       - Type is "history", dependency type is "path-connected"

2. **Variable Analysis:**
    a. **Graph Structure**:
        b. **Number of Variables** (type "observation_outcomes")
          - Number = 4
   Variable Connectivity:
          - Type is "shortest path", connectedness type is "longest path"

Key findings and analysis are:

1. **Matrix Dimension:**
    c. **Connection Types**
        - "path-connected": connectedness type
      
   **Connectedness:**
      d. **Directed edges**: (no dependency)
        
   **Independence**:
        e. **Independent variables**
          
   **Automatic dependencies**:
        f. **Variable connections**, with dependent variable not having a dependency

Key findings and analysis are:

1. **Model Complexity Analysis**:
    - Computational complexity indicators
       - "regularity" = 3
      - "bounded", "infinite range", "discrete transition probabilities"?
  
    - Potential bottlenecks or challenges
       - Can't optimize the graph structure yet?
