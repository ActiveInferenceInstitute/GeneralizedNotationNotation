# ANALYZE_STRUCTURE

Based on the document, here are the key steps in analyzing GNNs and Active Inference POMDP agents:
1. **GNN Section:**
   - Identify the type of information being processed (active inference agent for a discrete probability distribution) and its role within the model.
   - Determine the action selection strategy and hypothesis space from which actions are derived based on observed probabilities.
   - Analyze the state-of-the-art in active inference theory, including probabilistic graphical models and statistical networks.

2. **GNN VersionAndFlags section:**

   - Identify the type of information being processed (active inference agent for a discrete probability distribution) and its role within the model.
   - Determine the action selection strategy and hypothesis space from which actions are derived based on observed probabilities.
   - Analyze the state-of-the-art in active inference theory, including probabilistic graphical models and statistical networks.

3. **Model Annotation:**

   - Identify the type of information being processed (active inference agent for a discrete probability distribution) and its role within the model.
   - Determine the action selection strategy and hypothesis space from which actions are derived based on observed probabilities.
   - Analyze the state-of-the-art in active inference theory, including probabilistic graphical models and statistical networks.

4. **GNN Section:**

   - Identify specific variables (states) with different types of distributions, properties, or relationships related to action selection via probability distribution.
   - Analyze each variable's behavior using a multivariate approach based on their connected components and connections patterns.
   - Analyze the relationship between actions towards an objective value in terms of the network topology.

5. **Mathematical Structure:**

   - Identify special properties such as:
      - Symmetry or uniqueness properties (e.g., no-one has been chosen).
      - Unique solutions that have unique values at their local level.
      - Symmetries/unique solutions for the policy space through the initial action set.
   
   - Analyze network topology using computational complexity indicators and model scalability considerations, as well as potential bottlenecks or challenges based on specific domains (e.g., graph structure optimization).
