# EXTRACT_PARAMETERS

You're already close to understanding the structure of the GNN model and its components. The `GNN` section is a key component that allows you to extract information from data through probability distributions. This allows you to analyze how different elements interact, understand their relationships, and make predictions based on those interactions.

To provide accurate analysis, it's helpful if we can specify the parameters of the GNN model (like `A`, `B`, `C`, etc.), along with a detailed description or annotation of key features used in the calculation of the probability distributions. This provides further context and allows you to understand the underlying structure and behavior of the model.

Let's focus on analyzing the components of the GNN framework, including the input data (represented as matrices), which can be derived from previous statements about the data types. Then we'll examine specific parameters such as `A`, `B` (`policy_prior=habit`) to gain insights into how different elements interact and influence each other.

In terms of parameter analysis, it's beneficial if you provide a detailed description or annotations of key features used in the calculation of probability distributions for each dimension and/or time horizon (represented as matrices). This can help us understand the underlying structure and behavior of the model and make more informed predictions based on those interactions.
