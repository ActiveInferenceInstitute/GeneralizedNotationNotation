# EXTRACT_PARAMETERS

I've reviewed the documentation for GNN, including the equations and specifications of active inference agents with multiple observation modalities and hidden states. The key components are:

1. **Model Matrices**: A matrix representation of each agent's state space structure. This allows us to access its properties, such as probabilities over actions, biases on observables, and preferences encoded in the matrices' entries. The structure of the Matrix provides a way to describe how individual agents interact with their own parameters or other agents within the same parameter space.

2. **Transition Matrices**: A matrix representation of each agent's transition matrix describing how they update probabilities over observations. This allows us to access their properties and behavior in various scenarios, such as policy updates using Variational Free Energy (VFE) or action selection from Policy Prior (APP).

3. **History Metrics**: List statistics that describe the evolution of each agent's parameters over time. These metrics provide insight into how they change during an inference process. They can be used to optimize performance through training and testing algorithms.

4. **Random Field Metrics** (RBM): A probabilistic graphical model for random field estimation, which is a subset of Bayesian Inference but also offers some flexibility in allowing agents to have prior knowledge on their parameters. This helps to reduce the risk of overfitting or underfitting. RBMs are useful when there's no prior distribution available for each agent, and therefore can help optimize training and testing algorithms through the use of distributions other than Gaussian distributions (Gaussian Distribution) but also provide flexibility in terms of how the algorithm selects actions based on their prior knowledge/beliefs about those parameters.

5. **Variational Inference Metrics** (VIRM): Additional statistics used to evaluate agent behavior, such as Variance of Variability (Va), Variance of Variabilities (Vv), and Variarity of Variability (Vvar). These metrics provide insight into how the agents' behaviors change over time. They can be utilized by exploring different learning algorithms with varying parameter values or tuning specific hyperparameters to optimize performance through training/testing algorithms based on these metrics, as they represent a broader range of techniques that are applicable across a variety of use cases.

6. **Discrete Param Parameters** (DiParam)**: Additional statistics used to evaluate agent behavior, such as Discrete Variability (Dv), and the distribution of their parameters over time. These statistics provide insight into how they change during an inference process and can be utilized by exploring different learning algorithms that involve these statistics or tuning specific hyperparameters based on them, thus providing more information about the underlying mechanisms at play in their behavior than are provided through VIRM.

These metrics allow us to understand agent behavior better from a variety of angles. They provide insight into how they change over time and can help inform different learning algorithms that involve these statistics or utilize them for tuning specific hyperparameters, thereby providing more information about the underlying mechanisms at play in their behaviors and improving performance through them as well as identifying other patterns when analyzing them.

I'm interested to see where you'd like to explore further - particularly on how parameters are used by exploring different learning algorithms or searching for optimal strategies based upon these metrics so I can provide more information about the specifics of your work now?
