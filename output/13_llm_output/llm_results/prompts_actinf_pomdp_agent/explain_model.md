# EXPLAIN_MODEL

You're ready to share your analysis of the GNN example for Active Inference POMDP agent. Here's an overview of the key components and concepts:

1. **Model Purpose**: The GNN algorithm represents a classic Active Inference agent that processes observations based on hidden states, actions, preferences, and policy parameters. 

2. **Core Components**:
   - **Hidden States**: These are represented as lists (lists containing three elements) of values from 0 to 1 or 1 to 1 for each observation. Each state is associated with a probability distribution over future observations.
   - **History**: A history representing the entire graph structure, where states and their corresponding action histories can be accessed through actions. We denote this as a list containing one element: (observations_f0, observable_actions) which represents all possible actions available to the agent. 
   - **Habit**: This is represented by the list of observed observables associated with each state. For example, for an action 'a', `obsible_action` would represent the observable corresponding to that observation (each observable contains one value from a predefined sequence).
   - **Policy**: A list representing actions available at each time step (`actions`) and which can be assigned to each observed observable (`observables_f0`, etc.). 

3. **Model Dynamics**: How does this model implement Active Inference principles? What beliefs are being updated and what predictions it makes? 

Please provide clear explanations of key relationships, the modeling approach used for inference and prediction, the practical implications, etc.
