# EXPLAIN_MODEL

1. **Model Purpose**: This is a classic active inference POMDP agent that represents discrete actions and beliefs on the policy-guided action space with multiple observation modalities (states), hidden states, observations, actions, and control variables. It provides an example of using Variational Free Energy to update beliefs over future actions based on observed data points for each state.

2. **Core Components**:
   - **Likelihood Matrix**: Representing the likelihood map of each action-state pair. Each action corresponds to a single observation (observation) and one hidden state parameter space. There are 3 hidden states: one is assigned as the initial policy prior, another as the initial belief, and a third is assigned as an action when actions are selected based on hypothesis probabilities. There's also a habit associated with that action.

3. **Constraints**: The model has two constraints:
   - **Fixed Policy**: The policy can only be either "on" or "off". A "on" state corresponds to the current state and an "off" state means there was no observation in that state, but not yet when observations started (the policy is on), so the state remains the same. The goal is to update belief states based on observed data points for each state without considering past state transitions.

4. **Action Selection**: There are 3 actions:
   - **Actions**: Each action can be either "on" or "off". Actions with no observable behavior correspond to an "action-inactive_state", and when one is chosen, the corresponding belief (or belief after policy update) would change accordingly if there was another observation in that state. Similarly, actions with a property (policy updates), but not on themselves are considered as action-nonchangeable actions (which have no observable behavior).

5. **Information Update**: This model provides an example of updating beliefs over future actions based on observed data points for each state given the policy preferences.

6. **Practical Implications**: 
   - **Action Selection**: Actions with policy prior and action selection are used to update belief states when a state transition is triggered, enabling decision-making (action prediction).
   - **Knowledge Updates**: Given new observation information, actions can be updated based on previous policies or hypotheses associated with the current observation.

7. **Conclusion**: This model demonstrates how Active Inference can provide practical insights into complex decision-making scenarios by allowing for accurate forecasting of future actions based on data from past states and observing patterns in policy preferences that are derived through inference.
