# SUMMARIZE_CONTENT

Here's a concise overview of the structure:

1. **Overview** - A list summarizing key variables (hidden states, actions/controls), critical parameters (most important matrices), and features related to active inference models like Bayesian inference, Generative Models, GNN, etc.
   - Hidden states can be described as "probabilities across multiple observation paths" or "likelihood distributions", which are the core components of this model.

2. **Key Variables** - The variables associated with each parameter and feature, including their descriptions and relationships to other parameters/features:
   - Actions = "actions_permutations" (transitions)
   - Observations = "states_per_observation". These correspond to different actions and policy choices that the agent can make based on the current state.

3. **Critical Parameters** - Important matrices associated with each parameter, including hyperparameters (most important matrices), their settings, and key features or constraints related to specific scenarios:
   - Most important matrices/features are hidden states and actions of the model itself, as described earlier in this section. However, a more concise summary could be that hidden state is used as an input for actions prediction during initial inference and action selection from policy posterior when simulation runs are limited to time steps (discrete horizon).

4. **Notable Features** - Specific features/constraints related to the model design:
   - Special property or constraints of this model, which can influence specific scenarios within the agent's behavior:
   - Unique aspect of this model in terms of exploring different possible actions based on input information:
   - Unique aspects of this model that enable inference through other methods (e.g., using action selection from policy posterior).

5. **Use Cases** - Specific scenarios or user cases for which this model can be applied and how it applies to those situations, including what actions/controls/permutations are chosen based on input information:
   - Examples of specific use cases where the agent is defined with high confidence (e.g., when the policy has no prior knowledge in terms of action selection) or constrained by some constraint about the initial state/action configuration.
