**GNN Example:**
A classic active inference agent for POMDPs that uses Variational Free Energy (VFE) as the primary update mechanism. The algorithm updates hidden states to preferences, action selection based on habit distributions over actions, and then learns an initial policy prior using probabilistic graphical models and inference backends. This model is suitable for rendering into various simulation or inference backends, such as Markov Decision Processes and POMDPs with finite histories.

**Key Variables:**
   - **Hidden States**: [list of values]
   - **Observations**: [list of 3 x 3 matrices representing observed states]. Each is initialized in a different order from which actions are taken, leading to diverse action selections for each slice of time (s[0], s[1], etc.).
   - **Initialization Matrix**: [matrix with short descriptions](https://docs.google.com/a/math?class=github%3A_MIT-rpt#q=vf+h)

**Critical Parameters:**
   - **Most Important Matrices**: [list of matrices with brief description]
   - **Key Variables**: [string with short descriptions](https://docs.google.com/a/math?class=github%3A_MIT-rpt#q=vf+h)


**Notable Features:**
   - **Unique Properties**: [short description of the model]
   - **Extensive Description**: [long summary describing key parameters](https://docs.google.com/a/math?class=github%3A_MIT-rpt#q=vf+h)
