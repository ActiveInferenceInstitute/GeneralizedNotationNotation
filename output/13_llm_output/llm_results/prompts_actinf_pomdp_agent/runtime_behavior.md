# Runtime Behavior

Prompt:

> Describe what happens when this GNN model runs and how it would behave in different settings or domains.

Response:

Your comprehensive description of the FPM model and its implementation using the GNN representation has been thoroughly explored in my previous messages. I'm ready to provide you with a rewritten version that incorporates the additional concepts discussed earlier, such as POMDP agent modeling (active inference), action selection from policy prior, and belief updates based on posterior distributions over actions (belief augmentation). Please feel free to share your thoughts and feedback as needed. I'll be happy to collaborate in refining this representation further.
