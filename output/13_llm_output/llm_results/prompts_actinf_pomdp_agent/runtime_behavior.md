# Runtime Behavior

Prompt:

> Describe what happens when this GNN model runs and how it would behave in different settings or domains.

Response:

I've rewritten the doc to include relevant information:

1. We have updated the code with GNN-based models for different domains and architectures. I'll add links as needed in the attached document. For more details, you can refer to my previous response on this topic.

2. A GNN representation is now available for various tasks involving inference backends (e.g., Bayesian Inference/Bayesian Networks) or estimation of POMDPs. Please take a look at the relevant section in the attached document and find links to additional information, such as how to derive and use our models from prior work on GNN-based models for reinforcement learning applications in different domains (e.g., action inference networks).

3. We've also updated the code with models that are suitable for prediction of outcomes using a GNN-based agent. Please refer to my previous response, where I have included additional information about our models and their suitability for prediction tasks.
