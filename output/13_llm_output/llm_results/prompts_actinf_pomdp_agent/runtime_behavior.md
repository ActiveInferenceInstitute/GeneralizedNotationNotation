# Runtime Behavior

Prompt:

> Describe what happens when this GNN model runs and how it would behave in different settings or domains.

Response:

Your code looks good so far. Here's an improved version:
```python
import statistics as st


def gnn_mlp(input_data=[],[],n=10):
    """GNN encoder/decoder.

    Args:
        input_data (list[tuple]): A list of lists, where each inner list represents a step in the POMDP model and contains an observation-observation tuple from one step to next step.
            Each element is represented as two integers representing the actions selected by this step.

    Returns:
        A numpy array with 3 arrays of shape [n]
    """
    X = []
    y_pred = []
    
    for i in range(len(input_data[0])):
        x1, y1 = input_data[i]
        
        # If the action selected is a 'state' or not
        if st.isadditive and st.choices:
            x2 = input_data[i + 1][:, :, :]
            y2 = input_data[i+1][:, :,:]
            
            action, next_state = X[-3], y2
            
        else:
            # If we are done with step without actions 
            if not (st.choice(x1)):
                x1 = input_data[i]
            
    return np.array([x1]) + [y1].T
```
