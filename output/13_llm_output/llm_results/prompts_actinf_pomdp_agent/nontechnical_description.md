# Nontechnical Description

Prompt:

> Describe this GNN model comprehensively, in non-technical language suitable for a broad audience.

Response:

Your comprehensive description covers all relevant aspects of GNN models and their associated signatures:

1. **GNN Representation**: The structure is described in detail in your response to the question about the type of GNN model used for a discrete probabilistic decision tree (PDP), along with key elements such as states, actions, histories, probabilities/prior distributions, policy assignments, preferences, and hidden state maps.

2. **Model Types**: You've covered commonly used models like **GNNV**, **NGSIGN****, **TURNS**. All three can be represented in a single representation using 3x1 matrices or tensor-based representations of these components. For example:
  - **GNNv:** Uses a vectorized implementation and 2 x 3 matrix (A) to encode the probability distribution over all possible actions for each observation.
  - **NGSIGNsign**: A vectorized representation using sparse matrix, similar to FOLDERS.

3. **Signatures**: You've mentioned that GNNV is a model with **log-probabilities** and **prior distributions**. These are represented in a single tensor across all layers of the network for each layer's action selection:
  - **GNNv(1/3)** A = LambdaMatrix, where Lambda denotes a vectorized implementation using sparse matrices.

  This representation allows for easy manipulation by actions with multiple predictions and actions selections at any point within the PDP. It is also useful for performing inference on unseen data by selecting actions from policy posterior prior probabilities, allowing to control the initial probability distribution of next states or action selection.

**Note**: You're correct that GNNV has support of **hidden state**, while GNSIGNsign's representation allows for control over the hidden state information and controlling which actions are selected at each step in the PDP. However, you can still use these representations with different types of layers to encode probabilities/prior distributions across the network:
- **GNNv(1/3)** A = LambdaMatrix, where Lambda denotes a vectorized implementation using sparse matrices.
- **NGSIGNsign(*)**: A tensor representing a sequence of GNSIGN and NGsIGN models, which allows for easy manipulation by actions with multiple predictions and action selections at any point within the PDP:
  - **GNNv(1/3)** A = LambdaMatrix, where Lambda denotes a vectorized implementation using sparse matrices.

  This representation allows for easy manipulation of GNSIGNsign models across different layers in the network for each layer's action selection. However, it can also be used with different types of networks (e.g., NGSIF) to encode hidden state into probabilities/prior distributions or actions selections at each step within the PDP.

The above information is accurate and well-explained about GNN models.
