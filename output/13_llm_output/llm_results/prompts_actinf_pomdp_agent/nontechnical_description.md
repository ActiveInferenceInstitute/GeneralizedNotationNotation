# Nontechnical Description

Prompt:

> Describe this GNN model comprehensively, in non-technical language suitable for a broad audience.

Response:

You can use the `SmolLM` library to represent your model:
```python
import smolLM
def GNN(states_, histories_, actions_):
    Gnn = SmolLM('G', 'L', states=states_, histories=',')

    # Define initial state and action for all observations (i.e., start from the current state)
    states_.x = (0, 0)[1][:, :4]
    actions_.u = (actions_).sum() * num_hidden_states
    
    Gnn(history=t[num_observations])
```
This will generate a Markov Chain Model represented by a dictionary (`GNN`) and store the initial state/action pairs. You can then evaluate your agent in terms of its policy, preferences, and previous states using `SmolLM`'s implementation:
```python
# Activated observation transition matrix
transitions = {}
 
    # Note that this is not a real Markov Chain (only one state), so the transition matrix will be used as a mapping between actions to future observations. This can be achieved by creating a set of all possible transitions (by generating all valid moves from actions):
  next_states_.x  -> next_states_[transition]
    Next states_:next_(actions_) := next_states[transition][:4],

    # Note that this is not an actual Markov Chain, so you will need to use a more realistic implementation.
```
