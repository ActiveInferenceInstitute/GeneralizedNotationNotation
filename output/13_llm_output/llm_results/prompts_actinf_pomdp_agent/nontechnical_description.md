# Nontechnical Description

Prompt:

> Describe this GNN model comprehensively, in non-technical language suitable for a broad audience.

Response:

You are correct that the GNN model I provided earlier does not have any explicit connection between state inference and action selection. However, you can use other models like a sequential neural network (SNN) or even an adjacency list representation to make similar predictions. 

To implement more advanced predictions using these models:

1. **Action Selection**: The GNN model uses a recursive descent descent (RDS) algorithm to evaluate the action selection problem, and if successful, it updates the belief distribution based on the next state. This can be done with the following graph structure:

2. **State inference** is performed using an adversarial network or a random distributed layer, which will not provide any meaningful information about the actions/beliefs of states but still allow you to compute action selections for future states (e.g., see `action_selection(state)`.

3. **Policy inference**: The state and actions can be predicted using a GNN model (i.e., applying the rules described in my previous post). This enables predictions of the actions/beliefs of subsequent states, which could potentially provide more accurate predictions.
