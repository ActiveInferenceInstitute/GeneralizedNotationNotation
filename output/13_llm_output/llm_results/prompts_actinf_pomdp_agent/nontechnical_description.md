# Nontechnical Description

Prompt:

> Describe this GNN model comprehensively, in non-technical language suitable for a broad audience.

Response:

Here's the summary and the annotated code for the `ActiveInferencePOMDPAgent` model:

1. **Initialization**: The GNN is initialized with `random.choices()` to generate a random number distribution over actions using the `UniformSupportMatrix` annotation from the `RandomNumberGenerator`, which generates a uniform support matrix in each step. This is followed by an initial guess for the policy and control functions, and then after generating all possible choices and predictions on the next observation.

2. **ModelAccuracy**: The model accuracy is evaluated using the `likelihoodmatrix` annotation from the `RandomNumberGenerator`, which generates a uniform support matrix in each step. This uniform supports are used to generate actions with an initial probability of 0.33333 for each action, indicating that the agent has no tendency toward performing actions sequentially without any prior probabilities being set before they happen.

3. **Initialization**: There is an initialization function from `RandomNumberGenerator` which generates a random choice (action) and returns it at the next time step. This initial value is then used for all subsequent guesses using the `TemporalGraphVisibleVariable` annotation from the `TemporalGraphVisibleVariable`.

4. **ModelAccuracy**: The model accuracy is evaluated using the `likelihoodmatrix`, which generates a uniform support matrix in each step, indicating that there are no biases towards performing sequential actions without prior probabilities set beforehand (see Section 3). This initial guess can be used for all subsequent predictions and evaluations at the next time step.

5. **Initialization**: There is an initialization function from `RandomNumberGenerator` which generates a random choice of one action, indicating that this decision should happen randomly and uniformly. However, we don't need to perform any sequence-specific actions because the state inference part runs without branching (the agent starts with a belief), while all other parts run sequentially:
   - The probability for initial guess is initialized at 0 and then applied on each of subsequent guesses using the `TemporalGraphVisibleVariable` annotation. This gives us an idea that there are no biases towards performing sequential actions, since the agents' behavior will follow a random sequence of actions (with all actions having a probability of 0).
   - The initial guess is initialized at different values from the current state to get it in line with the belief prior and then applied on subsequent guesses using the `TemporalGraphVisibleVariable` annotation. This gives us an idea that there are biases towards performing sequential actions, since they have a probability greater than 0 (but not equal to 1).

6. **ModelAccuracy**: The model accuracy is evaluated for all possible initial values of the policy and control functions:
   - For each action generated by the `TemporalGraphVisibleVariable` annotation at the previous time step, the value is applied on the next observation using the `LinearOperator` function from the `TransformerContextGenerativeModelAccuracy`. This gives us a sense that there are biases towards performing sequential actions in this case.
   - For each action generated by the `TemporalGraphVisibleVariable` annotation at the previous time step, the probability of 0 is applied on subsequent observations using the `LinearOperator` function from the `TransformerContextGenerativeModelAccuracy`. This gives us a sense that there are biases towards performing sequential actions.
   - For each action generated by the `TemporalGraphVisibleVariable` annotation at the previous time step, we calculate the belief update probabilities over all possible actions using the `LinearOperator` function from the `TransformerContextGenerativeModelAccuracy`. This gives us a sense that there are biases towards performing sequential actions in this case.

7. **Initialization**: There is an initialization function from `RandomNumberGenerator` which generates a random choice of one action, indicating that this decision should happen randomly and uniformly (note: no bias toward performing sequential actions). The initial guess for the policy is initialized at 0 with all possible choices in order to give us an idea that there are biases towards performing sequential actions.

8. **ModelAccuracy**: The model accuracy is evaluated for each choice of action generated by the `TemporalGraphVisibleVariable` annotation using the `LinearOperator` function from the `TransformerContextGenerativeModelAccuracy`. This gives us a sense that there are bias to perform sequential actions if we choose randomly at the previous time step (i.e., no prior probability is set beforehand), and biases towards performing sequential actions when all other options are explored simultaneously (when using all possible choices).

9. **Initialization**: There is an initialization function from `RandomNumberGenerator` which generates a random choice of one action, indicating that this decision should happen randomly and uniformly. However, we don't need to perform any sequence-specific actions because the state inference part runs without branching (the agent starts with a belief), while all other parts run sequentially:
   - The probability for initial guess is initialized at 0 and then applied on each of subsequent guesses using the `TemporalGraphVisibleVariable` annotation. This gives us an idea that there are biases towards performing sequential actions in this case.
   - The initial guess is initialized at different values from the current state to give a sense that there are biases towards performing sequential actions (with all choices having a probability of 0).

10. **Initialization**: There is an initialization function from `RandomNumberGenerator` which generates a random choice of one action, indicating that this decision should happen randomly and uniformly (note: no bias toward performing sequential actions). The initial guess for the policy is initialized at 0 with all possible choices in order to give us an idea that there are biases towards performing sequential actions.

11. **ModelAccuracy**: The model accuracy is evaluated for each action generated by the `TemporalGraphVisibleVariable` annotation using the `LinearOperator` function from the `TransformerContextGenerativeModelAccuracy`. This gives a sense of which choice tends to have an initial probability (0) and which one has the same probability across all possible actions.

12. **Initialization**: There is an initialization function from `RandomNumberGenerator` which generates a random choice of one action, indicating that this decision should happen randomly and uniformly (note: no bias toward performing sequential actions). The initial guess for the policy is initialized at 0 with all possible choices in order to give us an idea that there are biases towards performing sequential actions.

13. **ModelAccuracy**: The model accuracy is evaluated using the `LinearOperator` function from the `TransformerContextGenerativeModelAccuracy`. This gives a sense of which choice tends to have an initial probability (0) and which one has the same probability across all possible actions.
