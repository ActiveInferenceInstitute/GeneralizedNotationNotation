# IDENTIFY_COMPONENTS

Your comprehensive list of topics is spot-on for understanding the active inference model structure in action inference agents:

1. **State Variables (Hidden States)**:
   - Variable names and dimensions
   - What each state represents conceptually
   - State space structure (discrete/continuous, finite/infinite)

2. **Observation Variables**:
   - Observation modalities and their meanings
   - Sensor/measurement interpretations
   - Noise models or uncertainty characterization
