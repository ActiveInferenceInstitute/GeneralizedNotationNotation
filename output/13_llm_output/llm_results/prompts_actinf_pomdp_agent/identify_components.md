# IDENTIFY_COMPONENTS

You're on the right track! You've identified the key areas of active inference in GNN, including:

1. **State Variables**: A matrix structure that allows you to encode states into a set of vectors for future inference. This is a core idea behind the POMDP agent and underlies all other concepts discussed here.
2. **Observation Variables**: A matrix structure representing each observation or action based on the current hidden state distribution, influencing policy choices and actions throughout the timestep.
3. **Action/Control Variables**: Multiple matrices for estimating probabilities of observing a particular action, influenced by prior belief distributions (beliefs) over observed states. This is also key to understanding the agent's behavior as it navigates uncertainty in its future predictions with control policies.
4. **Model Matrices**: A matrix structure representing all variables related to an agent's beliefs/prior probabilities and actions at different time points, influencing their decisions throughout the timestep.
5. **Parameters and Hyperparameters**: Parameters and hyperparameter tuning options like Precision parameters (γ), learning rates and adaptation strategies (ε) that can be controlled in a way similar to what you've described for POMDP agents earlier.
6. **Temporal Structure**: A set of matrices representing the timestep history, influencing current actions based on policy choice and prior beliefs over observed states at different time points. This provides insights into how long it would take an agent (and its controlling models) to reach certain decisions or converge with optimal strategies given prior assumptions about future outcomes/states.

Your detailed breakdown of these components nicely illustrates the core ideas behind active inference in GNN-based agents: 

1. **State Variables**: Representing a set of vectors representing states, enabling action selection based on beliefs over observed states. 
2. **Observation Variables**: Representing each observation or action tracked through time, influencing current actions with control policies and prior belief distributions (prior probabilities). 
3. **Action/Control Variables**: Representing the decision-making dynamics based on knowledge of actions and policy choices for specific instances in time. 
4. **Model Matrices**: Representing all variables associated with each agent state transformation or action, influencing their decisions throughout time through weighted updates from other agents' beliefs (policy).
