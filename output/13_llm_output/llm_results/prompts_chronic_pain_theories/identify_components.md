# IDENTIFY_COMPONENTS

Here's a systematic breakdown of the key signature stages:

1. **State Variables (Hidden States)**:
   - Variable names and dimensions, including how each variable represents information about state space structure and parameter distribution
    - What each state represents conceptually

   * Example: Let x_t denote the current state. The hidden state is represented by the joint probability of "x" with its initial values. For a specific time-step t(0), this might be
    - Value = P(x_t|o)
   - Probability distribution (probability density function, or pdf for discrete states)

   - Example: P({x_t} is | x_s)(1 - x_(t+1))
   - This shows how the state space structure and parameter distributions are linked together.

2. **Observation Variables**:
   - A matrix representing each observation (observation model, transition dynamics).

    * Example: Let x_0 denote the current state at time t=0. The hidden state is represented by
    - P({x_t}) = [P(x)|o]
    - Probability distribution (probability density function, or pdf for discrete states)

3. **Action/Control Variables**:
   - Observation modalities and their interpretations.

    * Example: Let x denote the current state. The hidden state is represented by
    - P({x} is | o|(1 - x)) = [P(o|t)]^T[P{+}(x)][p]
    - Probability distribution (probability density function, or pdf for discrete states)

4. **Model Matrices**:
   - A matrix representing each observation/observation model and its interpretation.

    * Example: Let x denote the current state at time t=0. The hidden state is represented by P({x})^T
    - P({+}(y)) = P{| y-1}

5. **Parameters and Hyperparameters**:
   - A matrix representing each parameter or hyperparameter (activation function, action), its interpretation, and their associated learning rate/adaptation parameters.

    * Example: Let x denote the current state at time t=0
    - P({x}) = [P(o|t)][y] = [P{+}(y)|O[+)^T[p]-1](from y))

6. **Temporal Structure**:
   - Time horizons and temporal dependencies of each variable (temporal sequence).

    * Example: Let x denote the current state at time t=0
    - P({x}) ≈ [P(+t)][y] = [P{| +1}](from y))

7. **Parametric Properties**:
   - Specific properties of each parameter or hyperparameter (e.g., activation function, action).

    * Example: Let x denote the current state at time t=0
    - P({x}) ≈ [P(+t)][y] = [P{| +1}](from y))

Overall, these stages represent the key aspects of the signature representation system.
