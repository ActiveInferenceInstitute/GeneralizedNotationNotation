# Runtime Behavior

Prompt:

> Describe what happens when this GNN model runs and how it would behave in different settings or domains.

Response:

The simulation model is composed of four nested timelines with distinct time scales. Each timeline provides insights into specific physiological processes, such as how various mechanisms interact and evolve over time. The simulations aim to demonstrate how different models can accurately capture the behavior in each timeline.

1. **Peripheral sensitization**: This timeline represents the central sensitivity component that governs acute pain responses throughout the trial, focusing on which model best captures its behavior across the three timescales tested (fast vs medium).
2. **Central sensitization**: This timeline is centered around the fear-avoidance cycle (slow beta time), where the model can accurately represent the behavior in each timeline and provide insight into how different models work together to mitigate pain transitions.
3. **Gate control**: This timeline represents the adaptive behavior of gating modulatory mechanisms, focusing on which model best captures its behavior across all timelines tested (fast vs medium).
4. **Neuromatrix**: This timeline is centered around functional adaptation processes that can accurately capture how different models work together to regulate pain modulation through time (slow beta versus fast beta) and other factors like cognitive resilience and behavioral modulations.
