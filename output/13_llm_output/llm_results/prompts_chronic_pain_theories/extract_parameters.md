Here's the structured list of steps:

1. **Data Source**: Provide a list of databases, data sets, or sources where you will store your dataset and models (e.g., datasets, models, metrics).

2. **Model Representation**: Describe your model in detail using a table format that shows its representation structure, such as the following steps:
   - **Classification**: List names for the classification type of the model (classification-type)
   - **Feature Selection**: List corresponding feature selection types and lists them again
   - **Prediction**: List corresponding prediction types (prediction types)
   - **Model Details**: List the metrics associated with each input shape

3. **Data Collection** or "Contextual Feature Collection" steps:
   1. **Dataset**: Provide a list of datasets that may contain your data, such as datasets and models (e.g., medical records).
   2. **Prediction**: Provide a list of prediction types for each type of input shape
4. **Model Details** or "Contextual Model Details" steps:
   1. **Classification**: List names for classification types of the model

    **Dataset**: List specific datasets that contain your data and models (e.g., medical records)

5. **Data Collection**: Provide a list of databases, data sets, or sources where you will store your dataset and models (e.g., datasets, models, metrics).
6. **Feature Selection** - List the corresponding input shape for each type of input shape
   1. **Classification**: List names for classification types of the model

    **Dataset**: List specific datasets that contain your data and models (e.g., medical records)

7. **Model Details** - List the respective mathematical operations associated with each input shape
8. **Data Collection** - Provide a list of databases, data sets, or sources where you will store your dataset and models (e.g., datasets, models, metrics).
