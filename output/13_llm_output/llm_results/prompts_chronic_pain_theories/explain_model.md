# EXPLAIN_MODEL

I've created a detailed summary of the model's purpose and key components:
1. **Purpose**: This document provides an overview of the model, including its core principles, analysis, and practical applications for healthcare and research purposes. The scope is broad, encompassing various phenomena studied in fields like neuroscience, psychology, epidemiology, medicine, biology, economics, sociology, computer science, philosophy, statistics (including data visualization tools), and more.

2. **Core Components**: We discuss the following key components:
   - **Hidden States**: Representing neural networks' potential states or actions that are not yet observable. Examples of hidden states include "slow", "fast", "peripheral" versus "central," "acute" versus "chronic." These represent different types of information that can influence the model's behavior and predictions over time.
   - **Observations**: Representing actual data points (i.e., actions, behaviors, physiological responses) or predicted outcomes based on existing knowledge or theoretical models. Examples of observations include "pain," "acute pain", "cogging tremor," "facial muscle contraction," etc.
   - **Action Constraints**: Representing relationships between states and action boundaries that can affect the model's behavior. These actions are modeled using Bayesian optimization algorithms, which enable dynamic updating based on new data (model updates). For example, "pain â†’ fpa" represents a decrease in pain intensity while reducing the likelihood of experiencing fear or avoidance behaviors.
   - **Interactions**: Representing interactions between hidden states and observed patterns to update predictions about outcomes and trajectories. These actions are modeled using machine learning algorithms that can learn from new data (model updates). For example, "activation: neuron + reward" represents a decrease in pain intensity while reducing the likelihood of experiencing fear or avoidance behaviors.
- **Active Inference**: The model implements Active Inference principles to predict outcomes based on observed patterns and actions. This helps researchers make predictions about complex behavior trajectories that can inform decisions (model updates). For example, "activation: neuron + brain activity + feedback" represents a decrease in pain intensity while reducing the likelihood of experiencing fear or avoidance behaviors.
- **Predictive Coding**: The model uses predictive coding to combine observed patterns into new predictions based on prior knowledge and historical data. This enables models to make informed decisions about future outcomes (action constraints) that can inform policy development, resource allocation, and other relevant outcomes in real-world applications (model updates).
