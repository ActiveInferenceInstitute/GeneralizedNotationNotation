# GNN Example: Neural Response Model
# GNN Version: 1.0
# This file specifies a comprehensive Active Inference model of how neurons respond to stimuli, including membrane dynamics, synaptic plasticity, adaptation, and homeostatic regulation. The model is suitable for rendering into various neural simulation backends.

## GNNSection
NeuralResponse

## GNNVersionAndFlags
GNN v1

## ModelName
Active Inference Neural Response Model v1

## ModelAnnotation
This model describes how a neuron responds to stimuli using Active Inference principles:
- One primary observation modality (firing_rate) with 4 possible activity levels
- Two auxiliary observation modalities (postsynaptic_potential, calcium_signal) for comprehensive monitoring
- Five hidden state factors representing different aspects of neural computation
- Three control factors for plasticity, channel modulation, and metabolic allocation
- The model captures key neural phenomena: membrane potential dynamics, synaptic plasticity (STDP-like), activity-dependent adaptation, homeostatic regulation, and metabolic constraints
- Preferences encode biologically realistic goals: stable firing rates, energy efficiency, and synaptic balance

## Equations
# Neural dynamics following Active Inference principles:
# - Membrane potential integrates synaptic inputs with conductance modulation: dV_m/dt = -g_L*(V_m - E_L) + I_syn + I_ext
# - Synaptic weights evolve via plasticity rules: dW/dt = η * STDP(V_m_pre, V_m_post, t_spike)
# - Adaptation accumulates with sustained activity: dA/dt = -A/τ_A + f(V_m)
# - Homeostatic set point adjusts to maintain target firing: H_t = H_{t-1} + α * (FR_target - FR_actual)
# - Metabolic state reflects energy balance: dM/dt = -c_activity * FR + r_allocation * M_alloc
#
# State inference: s_t ~ argmin_F [D_KL(q(s_t|o_{1:t}) || p(s_t|o_{1:t-1}, u_t))]
# Policy inference: π_t ~ argmin_G [E[G(π)] = Σ_τ E[Q(τ)] + D_KL(π || π_prior)]
# Action selection: u_t ~ π_t with softmax temperature τ
