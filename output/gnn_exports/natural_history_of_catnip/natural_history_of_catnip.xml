    <ModelName>The Natural History of Catnip: A Feline-Optimized Generative Model</ModelName>
    <ModelAnnotation>This model represents the complex dynamics of catnip (Nepeta cataria) through its natural history,
from germination to peak nepetalactone production, and the corresponding feline behavioral responses.

The model is specifically designed to generate melodious audio through SAPF processing that will appeal to cats:
- Frequency mappings optimized for feline hearing (1-3 kHz sweet spot)
- Harmonic structures based on purr frequencies (20-50 Hz fundamentals)
- Temporal dynamics that mirror natural cat behavior patterns
- Multi-modal sensory representations (visual, olfactory, tactile)

Hidden state factors model:
1. Catnip growth phases (5 states): Germination → Vegetative → Budding → Flowering → Seed Production
2. Nepetalactone concentration levels (4 states): Minimal → Low → Peak → Declining
3. Seasonal environmental conditions (4 states): Spring → Summer → Autumn → Winter
4. Feline response intensity (6 states): Indifferent → Curious → Interested → Excited → Euphoric → Overstimulated

Observation modalities capture:
1. Visual appearance (plant morphology, leaf density, flower presence)
2. Olfactory intensity (nepetalactone scent strength)
3. Tactile qualities (leaf texture, stem firmness)
4. Feline behavioral responses (approach, investigation, rolling, vocalizations)

The model incorporates circadian rhythms, seasonal variations, and the famous "catnip high" cycle
that creates natural oscillatory patterns perfect for musical generation.</ModelAnnotation>
