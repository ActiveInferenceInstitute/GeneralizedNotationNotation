Active Inference offers a unifying account of perception, learning, and action under the free energy principle [@friston2010], yet the generative models at its core are still communicated ad hoc: scattered across prose descriptions, bespoke notebooks, and framework-specific code that rarely agree. This fragmentation makes published models hard to reproduce, compare, or port between tools, and it raises the barrier for newcomers learning the formalism [@parr2022]. GeneralizedNotationNotation (GNN) addresses this gap with a standardized, human- and machine-readable text language for specifying Active Inference generative models, paired with a 25-step processing pipeline that transforms a single specification into validation, visualization, simulation, and analysis artifacts [@gnn2023]. A GNN file denotes a generative model, and the language lets that model take the several shapes the field actually uses: the notation blocks a file declares — categorical `A`/`B`/`C`/`D`[/`E`] tensors, linear-Gaussian system matrices `F`/`H`/`Q`/`R` with a Gaussian prior, per-agent and per-level compositions — fix its model kind, which the pipeline classifies structurally and carries through rendering and execution, recording explicitly which registered backends can render and run a model of each kind and which report it unsupported. GNN's "Triple Play" treats each model as three coordinated views — a textual specification, graphical visualizations, and executable cognitive models — so that one source yields consistent outputs across modalities. The framework spans 30 exemplar specifications (27 discrete-state and 3 continuous linear-Gaussian) across 9 model families and 9 registered rendering backends, with explicit gates for cross-format semantic fidelity and cross-framework reliability. GNN 3.0.0 layered safe-by-design long-running orchestration on top of this language and pipeline — durable observation streams, resumable run sessions, and auditable container plans that generate, validate, and replay data only, with no live infrastructure mutation. We describe the language, the model kinds it denotes, the pipeline architecture, and the validation that confirms specifications round-trip faithfully across formats and execute across multiple simulation backends — with coverage gaps recorded as explicit profiled-unsupported statuses rather than silently omitted — establishing GNN as reproducible, interoperable infrastructure for communicating Active Inference models.

# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

## Motivation

Active Inference has matured into a broad research program spanning the free energy principle [@friston2010], discrete state-space formulations of perception and action [@dacosta2020], and a growing body of pedagogy and reference implementations [@parr2022;@smith2022]. Recent graphical-specification and message-passing work makes the same practical pressure visible: active-inference agents need representations that can be inspected as model structure and then carried into executable inference updates without being reauthored by hand [@koudahl2023syntheticAgents1;@vandelaaar2023syntheticAgents2;@bagaev2021reactiveMessagePassing]. As the field has grown, so has a quieter problem: the models themselves are difficult to share, reproduce, and compare. A generative model that lives only as a tangle of matrix definitions inside one author's script, a diagram in a slide deck, and a paragraph of prose in a paper has no single authoritative form. The same model is described three times, in three incompatible media, with no guarantee that they agree. When a reader wants to re-run that model in a different toolkit, they must reverse-engineer it from whichever fragment they happen to have.

This is a reproducibility and interoperability crisis specific to the structure of Active Inference work. The discipline depends on precisely specified state spaces, observation and transition tensors, prior preferences, and policy structures; small notational ambiguities propagate into materially different behaviour. The heterogeneity of the models themselves compounds the problem: the field works in several model kinds at once — discrete categorical POMDPs over finite state spaces, continuous linear-Gaussian state-space models, multi-agent systems whose agents each carry their own generative vocabulary, hierarchical compositions layered over timescales — and each kind attracts its own notation, its own notebooks, and its own simulation stack. Yet the community has lacked a notation that is simultaneously human-readable, machine-parseable, and faithful to the underlying mathematics across those kinds. Generalized Notation Notation (GNN) was introduced to fill exactly that gap [@gnn2023]: a standard, text-based way to write down an Active Inference generative model once, such that every downstream use derives from the same source of truth.

## The GNN Approach

GNN treats the model specification as a first-class artifact. A model is written in a plain-text language whose syntax captures the components an Active Inference modeller actually reasons about — state factors, observation modalities, the matrices that link them, control structure, and the temporal organization of the model — and whose declared matrix vocabulary fixes which kind of generative model the file denotes: categorical `A`/`B`/`C`/`D`[/`E`] tensors for a discrete state-space model, linear-Gaussian system matrices for a continuous one, per-agent and per-level compositions for structured variants. Because the specification is text, it lives comfortably in version control, diffs cleanly across revisions, and can be authored and reviewed by humans without specialized tooling.

The defining commitment of GNN is what the project calls the Triple Play: a single text specification is the common origin for three coordinated renderings of the same model. The text form is the authoritative, editable description. From it, GNN produces graphical visualizations that expose the model's factor and dependency structure for inspection and communication. And from the same source it produces executable cognitive models that can actually be run, so that the diagram, the equations, and the running code are all generated from one parsed document rather than three artifacts that merely claim to describe the same model. The Triple Play turns a model from a description scattered across media into one specification with multiple faithful projections (see [@fig:triple_play]).

## Contributions

This work contributes a standard notation together with the infrastructure that makes it usable in practice:

- **A parseable, human-readable notation** for Active Inference generative models, whose text form is authoritative and from which every other representation is derived.
- **A model-kind taxonomy with per-kind rendering and execution semantics** — discrete categorical, continuous linear-Gaussian, multi-agent, hierarchical, learning, and structural kinds, classified structurally from the declared notation and rendered or recorded-unsupported per backend — so that what a specification can do on a given framework is a checkable property of the model's kind, not a trial-and-error discovery.
- **A 25-step processing pipeline** (0–24), whose stages are implemented across 44 source packages, that carries a specification from parsing and validation through visualization, rendering, and execution.
- **9 rendering backends** (PyMDP, RxInfer.jl, ActiveInference.jl, JAX, DisCoPy, PyTorch, NumPyro, Stan, bnlearn) that materialize a single GNN specification as backend-specific model code, of which 9 (PyMDP, RxInfer.jl, ActiveInference.jl, JAX, DisCoPy, PyTorch, NumPyro, Stan, bnlearn) also execute at Step 12, realizing the executable arm of the Triple Play.
- **142 Model Context Protocol tools** that expose the pipeline's capabilities to agentic and programmatic clients, so the notation and its tooling are directly accessible to automated workflows.
- **9-family reliability gates** that exercise the pipeline against a curated set of model families (basics, discrete, continuous, hierarchical, multiagent, precision, structured, gridworld, scaling-study), turning interoperability claims into checks that must pass rather than assertions that are merely made.

## Reader Orientation

The remainder of this manuscript is organized to move from language to mechanism to evidence. [@sec:system_context] states the notation and the model kinds it denotes — the discrete categorical factorization, its four matrices, and its two free-energy objectives as explicit equations ([@eq:generative_model] through [@eq:policy]), the continuous linear-Gaussian state-space kind with its optional closed-loop control structure ([@eq:lgssm_state] through [@eq:closed_loop]), and the multi-agent, hierarchical, learning, and structural compositions — and it presents the model-kind table ([@tbl:model_kinds]), the pipeline structure ([@fig:pipeline]), the Triple Play ([@fig:triple_play]), and the per-step responsibility table ([@tbl:pipeline_steps]). [@sec:methods] follows a specification through the pipeline — parsing, kind-scoped type checking, rendering, execution, and reporting — and presents the backend registry ([@tbl:backend_registry]), the per-kind framework capability matrix ([@tbl:framework_capability]), the backend registry surface ([@fig:backend_matrix]), and the long-running orchestration contracts ([@fig:orchestration]). [@sec:artifacts_evidence] reports what the project has produced and how each number is grounded, with the model-family registry ([@tbl:model_families]), the family-by-framework coverage ([@fig:family_matrix]), and repository-scale metrics ([@fig:repo_metrics]). [@fig:graphical_abstract] condenses this same arc — specification, validation, rendering, execution, analysis, and interchange — into the summary panel at the head of the manuscript. Claims of independent re-execution are addressed in [@sec:reproducibility], the boundaries of the current system in [@sec:limitations_next_steps], the symbol and construct tables in [@sec:symbols_glossary], and full source details in [@sec:references]. Read in this order, the manuscript moves from why a standard notation is needed, through how GNN realizes it across model kinds, to the evidence that the standard holds.

# System Context {#sec:system_context}

Generalized Notation Notation (GNN) couples a small, declarative text language for generative models in the Active Inference lineage to a deterministic processing pipeline that turns each specification into validation, visualization, simulation, and analysis artifacts [@gnn2023]. The language gives a model one canonical written form; the pipeline gives that form many executable and graphical realizations. This section describes both halves of the architecture and the way they meet, and it states the mathematical objects the language is obliged to carry — per model kind, because the language is not tied to a single shape of generative model.

## The GNN Language

A GNN model is a plain-text document organized into named sections that together pin down the generative model its author intends. The `StateSpaceBlock` declares the variables of the model and their dimensions — hidden states, observations, control factors, policies, or the system matrices of a continuous model — establishing the shape of every tensor that follows. The `Connections` section records the directed and undirected dependencies among those variables, the edges of the underlying factor graph that downstream tools read to lay out diagrams and wire up inference. Which family of generative model a file declares is decided by the notation the file carries, not by its filename or its directory: the declared matrix vocabulary is what the pipeline reads to classify the model, as [@sec:model_kinds] specifies. The full construct vocabulary is catalogued in [@tbl:gnn_constructs].

## Model Kinds {#sec:model_kinds}

Every GNN file denotes one generative model, and the language lets that model take several distinct mathematical shapes. A file whose `StateSpaceBlock` declares the categorical tensors `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` — optionally `E` — denotes a discrete state-space generative model. A file that declares the system matrices `F`, `H`, `Q`, `R` together with a Gaussian prior over the initial state (`prior_mean`, `prior_cov`) denotes a continuous linear-Gaussian state-space model. Per-agent and per-level declarations (`A_agent1`, `A_level1`, …) compose the categorical vocabulary into multi-agent and hierarchical structures. A file that declares boundary structure only — neither a categorical nor a continuous parameterization — is a structural wrapper: it names the model's interfaces but carries no renderable form.

The pipeline classifies each parsed specification structurally, and it does so from typed fields alone: the raw `## GNNSection` value, the declared matrix-key patterns, explicit agent counts, and explicit `## ModelParameters` keys. The classifier (`detect_model_kind` in `src/gnn/render/pomdp_contract.py`) resolves kinds in a fixed precedence order — multi-agent, then hierarchical, then continuous, then learning, then factored, then structural, then the flat single-factor case — so the more specific structure wins when a file exhibits several at once. Two properties of this classification matter for everything downstream. First, it is structural, not textual: prose in a model name or annotation never changes how a model renders, so a passing mention of "Dirichlet" in free text cannot reroute a specification into the parameter-learning kind. Second, it is computed from the parsed specification, not asserted by the author: the same file classifies the same way on every machine, which is what lets rendering and execution behavior be stated per kind rather than per file. The taxonomy, its notation blocks, exemplar folder, and rendering and execution reach per kind are enumerated in [@tbl:model_kinds].

| Model kind | Notation block | Exemplar folder | Renderer(s) | Executor(s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Discrete categorical | `A`/`B`/`C`/`D`[/`E`] (column-stochastic `B` slices) | `input/gnn_files/discrete/` | all 9 registry frameworks | all 9 registry frameworks |
| Continuous linear-Gaussian | `F`/`H`/`Q`/`R` + priors (optional closed-loop pair) | `input/gnn_files/continuous/` | RxInfer.jl, JAX, PyTorch, NumPyro, Stan | RxInfer.jl, JAX, PyTorch, NumPyro, Stan |
| Multi-agent | `nr_agents` + per-agent matrix keys (`A_agent1`, …) | `input/gnn_files/multiagent/` | all 9 registry frameworks | all 9 registry frameworks |
| Recursive | — | `input/gnn_files/recursive/` | — | — |
: The model kinds the pipeline represents and executes, one row per kind. Notation blocks are the parameterization each kind declares; exemplar folders are the committed corpus under `input/gnn_files/`. Renderer(s)/Executor(s) cells are generated from the registry flags (see [@tbl:framework_capability]): the two parameterization rows carry their own flag sets, and multi-agent inherits the discrete row's coverage because its per-agent matrix keys canonicalize through the same discrete A/B/C/D render path; `recursive/` is reserved for bounded `--autonomous` proposal-loop runs and holds no committed models. {#tbl:model_kinds}

### The Discrete Categorical Kind

A discrete specification denotes a partially observable Markov decision process over a horizon $T$, factorized as in [@eq:generative_model] following the standard formulation [@dacosta2020; @smith2022].

$$
P(o_{1:T},\, s_{1:T},\, \pi) \;=\; P(\pi)\; P(s_1) \prod_{t=1}^{T} P(o_t \mid s_t) \prod_{t=2}^{T} P(s_t \mid s_{t-1},\, \pi)
$$ {#eq:generative_model}

The four matrices named in the `StateSpaceBlock` are exactly the factors of [@eq:generative_model], and this correspondence is what makes the notation translatable rather than merely descriptive. The `A` matrix is the likelihood, a column-stochastic map from hidden states to observation outcomes, given in [@eq:likelihood].

$$
P(o_t = i \mid s_t = j) \;=\; A_{ij}, \qquad \sum_i A_{ij} = 1
$$ {#eq:likelihood}

The `B` matrix is the controlled transition dynamics: one column-stochastic slice per action, as in [@eq:transition]. The canonical reading of the tensor is column-stochastic, `B[next_state][previous_state][action]`, matching the convention of the discrete message-passing libraries the pipeline targets [@heins2022]; validation records every declared tensor's detected orientation and can transpose row-stochastic textbook literals on request, as described in [@sec:methods].

$$
P(s_{t+1} = i \mid s_t = j,\, u_t = k) \;=\; B^{(k)}_{ij}, \qquad \sum_i B^{(k)}_{ij} = 1
$$ {#eq:transition}

The `C` vector holds log-preferences over observations, which enter inference as the biased outcome distribution of [@eq:preference]; the `D` vector is the prior over initial hidden states, [@eq:prior].

$$
\tilde{P}(o_t = i) \;=\; \sigma(C)_i \;=\; \frac{\exp C_i}{\sum_j \exp C_j}
$$ {#eq:preference}

$$
P(s_1 = i) \;=\; D_i, \qquad \sum_i D_i = 1
$$ {#eq:prior}

Given those factors, perception is approximate Bayesian inference: a variational posterior $Q(s)$ is fitted by minimizing the variational free energy of [@eq:vfe], which decomposes into a complexity term and an accuracy term [@friston2010].

$$
F[Q] \;=\; \underbrace{D_{\mathrm{KL}}\!\left[\,Q(s) \,\|\, P(s)\,\right]}_{\text{complexity}} \;-\; \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{Q(s)}\!\left[\ln P(o \mid s)\right]}_{\text{accuracy}}
$$ {#eq:vfe}

Action is expected-free-energy minimization: each policy $\pi$ is scored over future steps $\tau$ by [@eq:efe], whose two terms are the information gain a policy is expected to yield and the extent to which its predicted outcomes match `C` [@dacosta2020].

$$
G(\pi) \;=\; -\underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{Q(o_\tau,\, s_\tau \mid \pi)}\!\left[\ln Q(s_\tau \mid o_\tau, \pi) - \ln Q(s_\tau \mid \pi)\right]}_{\text{epistemic value}} \;-\; \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{Q(o_\tau \mid \pi)}\!\left[\ln \tilde{P}(o_\tau)\right]}_{\text{pragmatic value}}
$$ {#eq:efe}

The policy posterior then combines those scores with the habit prior `E` declared in the specification, as in [@eq:policy], and the selected action $u$ is sampled from it.

$$
Q(\pi) \;=\; \sigma\!\left(\ln E - G\right)
$$ {#eq:policy}

The discrete categorical kind is the language's original and most densely exercised target: 27 of the 30 exemplar specifications in the corpus are discrete-state. The discrete family folder holds the kind's core set — from minimal `markov_chain.md` and `hmm_baseline.md` fixtures through epistemic planning (`tmaze_epistemic.md`) and deep planning horizons (`deep_planning_horizon.md`) to the canonical full agent (`actinf_pomdp_agent.md`) — and further categorical fixtures populate the basics, precision, structured, gridworld, and scaling-study corpora. The kind composes upward as well: multiple independent state factors (a factored model), per-level and per-agent matrix declarations ([@sec:structural_variants]), and Dirichlet priors that turn a declared matrix into a learned latent ([@sec:limitations_next_steps]) are all extensions of this same categorical substrate.

Recent work continues to refine how expected-free-energy objectives relate to variational inference and to alternative but equivalent formulations, which is why GNN keeps the objects of [@eq:generative_model] through [@eq:policy] explicit in the notation rather than burying them in backend-specific code [@champion2024reframingEfe;@nuijten2026typeInference;@nuijten2026efePlanningVariational]. A `ModelParameters` section fixes the scalars those objects depend on — factor cardinalities and precision terms — while a `Time` section declares whether the model is static or dynamic and, if dynamic, how the horizon $T$ and its discretization are organized. Because every one of these sections is explicit text, a GNN file is at once human-readable, diffable under version control, and unambiguous to a parser — the property that lets the rest of the pipeline operate deterministically.

### The Continuous Linear-Gaussian Kind

A file whose `StateSpaceBlock` declares `F`, `H`, `Q`, `R` together with `prior_mean` and `prior_cov` denotes a continuous-state linear-Gaussian state-space model stepped in discrete time: a Gaussian latent state $x_t \in \mathbb{R}^n$ evolves linearly, and a Gaussian observation $y_t \in \mathbb{R}^m$ reads it out linearly.

$$
x_1 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_0,\, \Sigma_0), \qquad x_t = F\, x_{t-1} + u_{t-1} + w_t, \qquad w_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\, Q)
$$ {#eq:lgssm_state}

$$
y_t = H\, x_t + v_t, \qquad v_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\, R)
$$ {#eq:lgssm_obs}

Here `F` is the state-transition matrix, `H` the observation matrix, `Q` the process-noise covariance, and `R` the observation-noise covariance; `prior_mean` ($\mu_0$) and `prior_cov` ($\Sigma_0$) fix the Gaussian prior over the initial state, so the model's randomness is declared entirely in its parameterization rather than in categorical tables. The shape contract mirrors the semantics: `prior_mean` must carry exactly $n$ entries, and `Q`, `R`, and `prior_cov` must be $n \times n$, $m \times m$, and $n \times n$ respectively — a mismatch is a validation-time diagnostic in the notation, not a runtime surprise inside a numerical backend.

The kind also carries an optional closed-loop control structure. When a specification declares `goal_mean` ($\mu^\star$, the preferred state) and `control_gain` ($k$, a scalar proportional gain) alongside a control input $u_t$, the rendered model closes the loop on beliefs: the controller steers the filtered posterior mean toward the preferred state.

$$
u_t \;=\; k \,\bigl(\mu^\star - \mu_t\bigr), \qquad \mu_t = \mathbb{E}\!\left[x_t \,\middle|\, y_{1:t}\right]
$$ {#eq:closed_loop}

This is how `input/gnn_files/continuous/continuous_navigation.md` is built: a two-dimensional navigator whose position persists between steps ($F = I$), whose observation is a noisy identity readout of that position, and whose control input pushes the believed position toward `goal_mean` with gain `control_gain`. The other continuous exemplars are passive: `predictive_coding_agent.md` and `stochastic_dynamics.md` filter without steering. In total the corpus ships 3 continuous linear-Gaussian exemplars in the continuous family folder. Symbolically the kind reuses letters the discrete vocabulary already claims — most prominently `F`, which names the state-transition matrix here and the variational free energy in [@eq:vfe] — and [@sec:symbols_glossary] resolves that collision by scoping each symbol table to its kind.

### Multi-Agent, Hierarchical, and Structural Kinds {#sec:structural_variants}

The remaining kinds are structural compositions of the two parameterization vocabularies above, and the classifier recognizes each by its declared key pattern rather than by convention.

**Multi-agent.** A specification with an explicit agent count greater than one, or with per-agent matrix keys (`A_agent1`, `B_agent1`, `C_agent1`, …), declares a multi-agent model: each agent carries its own categorical vocabulary, and coordination is expressed in the `Connections` section rather than by merging the agents into one joint table. `input/gnn_files/multiagent/stigmergic_swarm.md` is the worked exemplar — three agents coordinating through environmental traces (stigmergy) on a shared grid, with no direct communication between them — alongside `multi_agent_coordination.md` and a compact clustered mean-field acceptance fixture.

**Hierarchical.** Per-level matrix keys (`A_level1`, `B_level1`, `A_level2`, …) declare a multi-level model in which one level's beliefs supply another level's context — `input/gnn_files/hierarchical/hierarchical_pomdp.md` couples a fast lower level to a slow higher level that switches its context, and `temporal_hierarchy.md` develops the same structure over time. For categorical backends the per-level matrices are composed into one joint POMDP; the RxInfer.jl renderer additionally carries native strategies for two-level models, so a hierarchy can render either composed or natively depending on the target.

**Learning and factored.** A specification that declares a Dirichlet prior over one of its matrices (`dirichlet_A`, …) — or sits in a declared learning corpus — is the parameter-learning kind: a matrix becomes a latent variable inferred from observations rather than a fixed table. `input/gnn_files/learning/dirichlet_likelihood_learning.md` is the worked exemplar: its `StateSpaceBlock` still declares `A[3,3]` in the categorical vocabulary, but `A` is a latent variable with prior pseudo-counts declared in `dirichlet_A[3,3]`, and hidden-state inference and likelihood learning run jointly by variational message passing with a mean-field factorization. The file is explicit about what its `InitialParameterization` means — the numeric `A` there is the environment's ground-truth likelihood that the agent never observes and must recover, not the agent's belief — and its annotation records why the Dirichlet prior is identity-biased rather than uniform: a fully uniform prior leaves the column-permutation symmetry unbroken and inference converges to a label-switched optimum. A specification whose `## ModelParameters` declare more than one independent state factor without per-level or per-agent keys is the factored kind, the standard multi-factor categorical POMDP.

**Structural.** A file that declares boundary structure only — a Markov-blanket-style wrapper with neither a categorical `A`/`B`/`C`/`D`[/`E`] parameterization nor a continuous `F`/`H`/`Q`/`R` one — is classified structural and is render-only and informational: it names interfaces the surrounding system can reason about, and every framework reports it `unsupported` with the reason that it has no renderable form, rather than being forced through a discrete render path that would fail on missing matrices.

**The recursive corpus.** The `input/gnn_files/recursive/` directory is reserved for bounded `--autonomous` proposal-loop runs and holds no committed models; recursion today enters the taxonomy as structure — a level referencing its own kind, as in the hierarchical compositions above — rather than as a separately renderable kind. The corpus directory is part of the tree so that autonomous runs have a bounded, inspectable home, and its emptiness is a fact of the current release rather than an omission of the documentation.

### Reading Exemplars by Kind

Each kind is best understood through a specification that exercises it, and the corpus pairs every kind with at least one canonical exemplar. Reading one file per kind side by side makes the notation-block difference — the entire content of the taxonomy — concrete.

The discrete canonical is `input/gnn_files/discrete/actinf_pomdp_agent.md`, a fully controllable one-factor POMDP. Its `StateSpaceBlock` declares `A[3,3]`, `B[3,3,3]`, `C[3]`, `D[3]`, and `E[3]` — one observation modality, one hidden-state factor, and three actions — and every tensor of [@eq:generative_model] through [@eq:policy] is present by name: `A` carries the likelihood mapping, `B` carries the controlled transitions in the canonical column-stochastic slice order, `C` holds log-preferences, `D` the initial-state prior, and `E` the habit prior. The `Connections` section then wires the inference cycle explicitly — `D>s` conditions the initial belief, `s-A` ties states to observations, `C>G` and `E>π` feed preference and habit into policy scoring, and `π>u` closes the loop from policy to action — so the file reads as a literal transcription of [@eq:vfe] and [@eq:efe] into declared variables and edges.

The continuous canonical is `input/gnn_files/continuous/continuous_navigation.md` ([@eq:lgssm_state] through [@eq:closed_loop]). Its `StateSpaceBlock` declares no categorical tensors at all: `x[2,1]` and `y[2,1]` are the Gaussian state and observation, `F[2,2]`, `H[2,2]`, `Q[2,2]`, and `R[2,2]` carry the linear dynamics and noise, `prior_mean[2]` and `prior_cov[2,2]` fix the initial belief, and `goal_mean[2]` and `control_gain[1]` add the closed-loop control structure. The `InitialParameterization` gives the matrices numerically — identity dynamics and identity readout, diagonal process and observation noise, a prior centered on the origin, a preferred position, and the proportional gain — and the `Equations` section restates [@eq:lgssm_state], [@eq:lgssm_obs], and [@eq:closed_loop] as the model's declared dynamics. Nothing about the file is a discretized stand-in for a POMDP; it is a linear-Gaussian model by declaration, which is what lets the classifier label it `CONTINUOUS` and the continuous-capable backends render it natively.

The composed kinds show their structure in their key names. `input/gnn_files/multiagent/stigmergic_swarm.md` declares `A_agent1[4,9]`, `B_agent1[9,9,4]`, `C_agent1[4]`, and `D_agent1[9]`, then repeats the block for each further agent, so the per-agent pattern that the classifier keys on is visible directly in the `StateSpaceBlock`; coordination between the agents is expressed through shared environment variables in `Connections`, not by merging the agents into one joint table. `input/gnn_files/hierarchical/hierarchical_pomdp.md` declares `A_level1[4,4]` and `A_level2[4,2]` with matching per-level transitions and priors — a fast lower level whose beliefs a slow higher level contextualizes — and it is these per-level keys that let the categorical backends compose the levels into one joint POMDP while the RxInfer.jl strategies render the two levels natively. In every case the classification is a mechanical reading of the declared names, which is the property that keeps the taxonomy honest: a file is its kind because of what it declares, not because of where it sits.

### What the Kind Classification Governs

The classification is not an annotation a report displays and forgets; it governs observable pipeline behavior at each stage that touches a model. At the render step, the per-framework receipts group outcomes into three disjoint sets — frameworks processed, frameworks failed, and frameworks unsupported — and the unsupported set is excluded from the success denominator rather than counted against it: a categorical backend facing a continuous model, or any backend facing a structural wrapper, reports a status with a reason and drops out of the rate, so a pipeline run over a mixed-kind corpus neither inflates its failures nor hides its gaps. At the execute step the same discipline applies, with skipped and degraded lanes recorded as explicit statuses. At the analysis and reporting steps, the receipts keep the distinctions legible: a continuous model whose categorical-only lanes report `unsupported` by capability reads differently from a discrete model whose continuous attempt failed, and the per-family acceptance ledger that the model-family gate writes carries those statuses per family, per backend, per step.

The governance runs in the direction the taxonomy promises: classification is computed once from the parsed specification and consumed everywhere downstream, so the render receipts, the execution traces, and the acceptance ledger all describe the same kind for the same file. A reader auditing any of those artifacts can recompute the classification from the file's declared vocabulary alone — [@tbl:model_kinds] is the key — and expect to match what the pipeline recorded, which is what makes the kind taxonomy a checkable claim rather than a documentation convention.

## The Processing Pipeline

The pipeline is a fixed sequence of 25 numbered steps, 0–24, each a self-contained stage that consumes the artifacts of its predecessors and writes typed outputs for those that follow. Early steps parse and type-check the GNN text and validate it against the language schema; middle steps render visualizations, export the model to executable backends, and run simulations; later steps perform analysis, reporting, and downstream integration. The data dependencies among the steps form the directed acyclic graph shown in [@fig:pipeline], which makes the whole flow inspectable: any artifact can be traced back to the step that produced it and forward to every step that depends on it.

![The 25-step GNN processing pipeline as a directed acyclic graph, laid out left to right by topological layer and colored by execution phase (legend, upper right). Each node is the thin step orchestrator under `src/gnn/` named in [@tbl:pipeline_steps]; each arrow is a hard data dependency parsed from the Data Dependency Graph block of `src/gnn/STEP_INDEX.md`, so any artifact can be traced back to the step that produced it. Parsing (Step 3) fans out to nearly every later step, and analysis (Step 16) collects enrichment from execution, visualization, and the LLM step.

: The pipeline steps with the thin orchestrator module that owns each and the one-line purpose parsed from the master table in `src/gnn/STEP_INDEX.md`. Read the Step column against the arrows of [@fig:pipeline]: each row's purpose is the transformation that module owns, and the table is regenerated from the index at every build, so it cannot drift from the code it describes. {#tbl:pipeline_steps}

This staged design keeps the architecture modular. The implementation is organized into 44 source packages, one cluster of responsibilities per concern, and is documented across 624 documentation files so that each step's contract, inputs, and outputs are specified independently of the others. New backends or analyses attach to the graph by declaring their dependencies rather than by editing a monolith, and the deterministic step ordering means a model processed today yields the same artifacts when reprocessed tomorrow. The pipeline is kind-agnostic in its plumbing and kind-aware at its edges: parsing, validation, and export operate on whatever the file declares, while the rendering and execution steps consult the classification of [@sec:model_kinds] to decide which backends a given model can reach and record, explicitly, the ones it cannot.

## The Triple Play

The reason for separating a single written language from a multi-stage pipeline is the design goal GNN calls the Triple Play: one model specification, three coordinated modes of existence. The same GNN text is simultaneously a human-readable model description, a set of graphical visualizations of its state space and factor structure, and an executable cognitive model that can be run as a simulation. @fig:triple_play depicts these three faces and the shared specification at their center.

![The Triple Play: one GNN text specification (left) and its three coordinated projections (right) — the human-readable text form, graphical model visualizations, and executable simulation code. All three arrows originate at the same source box because all three projections are generated from one parsed document, which is why they cannot drift apart; the executable node states that 9 of 9 registered backends run at Step 12 and previews three of them by name. Counts are producer tokens at commit 13bd0637c, and the panel is generated by `scripts/manuscript_fig_triple_play.py`. Take-away: a model is authored once and then read, seen, and run from that single source.](../figures/gnn_triple_play.png){#fig:triple_play width=70%}

Each face is generated from the same source, so they cannot drift apart. The text is the contract a researcher reads and reviews; the visualizations expose the factor-graph structure for inspection and communication; and the executable rendering lets the identical model be simulated across inference frameworks, connecting the written specification to the discrete message-passing libraries for categorical Active Inference [@heins2022], to the reactive message-passing and probabilistic-programming engines that carry the linear-Gaussian kind, and to the broader tooling ecosystem for compositional model representation [@defelice2021]. Because all three derive from one parsed document, GNN turns a model from a static artifact into a live object that can be read, seen, and run without re-encoding it for each purpose [@smith2022]. The Triple Play holds per kind: each of the three faces is generated from the same classification the pipeline computed at parse time, so the diagram a reader sees, the notation a reviewer diffs, and the program a backend executes are all projections of one declared model kind rather than three loosely coupled guesses about what the file meant.

# Methods {#sec:methods}

The GeneralizedNotationNotation (GNN) method is realized as a sequence of deterministic transformations that take a plain-text model specification and carry it through parsing, validation, code generation, execution, and reporting. The processing pipeline is organized into 25 numbered steps (steps 0–24), each implemented as a standalone module with a single responsibility. The methods below describe the path that a model travels from notation to executable cognitive model and back to analyzed results, and they state that path per model kind wherever the kinds part ways: the pipeline's plumbing is kind-agnostic, but rendering and execution are kind-aware by design. Every quantity reported in this section is produced from the live repository rather than asserted by hand; the closing subsection makes that contract explicit.

## Parsing and Multi-Format Export

The pipeline begins by ingesting GNN model files written in the plain-text notation. Parsing (step 3) reads each specification, builds an internal model representation, and re-emits it across a family of structured export formats so that downstream tools, and human readers, can consume the same model through whichever serialization they prefer. The corpus that exercises this stage spans 30 example model files organized into 11 curated corpora, and it spans the model kinds of [@sec:model_kinds]: minimal perception fixtures used to test the parser, discrete categorical agents, continuous linear-Gaussian state-space models, multi-agent swarms, hierarchical two-level compositions, and the scaling-study corpus that grows a single family across state-space sizes. The presence of hierarchical fixtures should be read as a coverage target, not as a claim that every current backend fully executes every hierarchical formulation; scaling hierarchical active inference remains an active research problem in its own right [@rangarajan2026hierarchicalSuccessor]. Treating parsing and export as a single round-trippable stage means a model authored once becomes immediately available as a typed object, a normalized text form, and machine-readable serializations without any manual re-encoding — and because the typed object carries the declared matrix vocabulary verbatim, the kind classification of [@sec:model_kinds] is computed from the parse result rather than re-derived downstream.

## Type Checking and Validation

A model that parses is not yet a model that is well-formed. Steps 5 and 6 apply type checking and validation to confirm that the state spaces, observation modalities, control factors, and the matrices relating them are mutually consistent before any code is generated. This catches dimensional mismatches and malformed factor structures at the notation level, where the diagnostic is cheap and legible, rather than allowing them to surface as opaque runtime errors deep inside a numerical backend. Validation is where the kinds receive their shape contracts, and each kind's contract checks the objects its notation actually declares.

For a discrete categorical specification, validation reads each declared `B` tensor through an orientation diagnostic: the canonical reading is column-stochastic, `B[next_state][previous_state][action]`, matching the pymdp convention [@heins2022] and the transition semantics fixed by [@eq:transition], and the check records every tensor's detected orientation in its receipt. A row-stochastic textbook literal — the transpose of the canonical layout — is flagged with the tensor, state factor, and flipped slice indices named, and the opt-in `--transpose-b` flag maps such literals onto the canonical order at load time instead of failing them, recording the transposition per tensor.

For a continuous linear-Gaussian specification, validation enforces the Gaussian shape contract of [@eq:lgssm_state] and [@eq:lgssm_obs]: `prior_mean` must carry exactly as many entries as the latent state, `Q` and `prior_cov` must be square in the state dimension, and `R` must be square in the observation dimension. A covariance whose shape disagrees with the state or observation declaration is a validation-time diagnostic naming the mismatched matrix and its dimensions, not a broadcast error inside a generated script; and the optional closed-loop declarations are checked as a pair, since a `goal_mean` without a `control_gain` (or the reverse) is an incomplete control structure rather than a passive model.

Validation here is the gate that protects every later stage: rendering, execution, and analysis all assume a model that has already been certified consistent for its kind.

## Rendering to Multiple Backends

The central act of the "Triple Play" is turning a validated specification into executable cognitive models. The rendering stage emits backend-specific code for 9 registered target frameworks — PyMDP, RxInfer.jl, ActiveInference.jl, JAX, DisCoPy, PyTorch, NumPyro, Stan, bnlearn — so that a single GNN model can be instantiated as a simulation in whichever computational ecosystem a researcher already works in. Each backend is addressed through a registry key that maps the abstract model onto that framework's idioms for representing generative models and performing inference. The full mapping from registry key to backend is given below.

| Registry key | Backend | Executes |
|---|---|---|
| `pymdp` | PyMDP | yes |
| `rxinfer` | RxInfer.jl | yes |
| `activeinference_jl` | ActiveInference.jl | yes |
| `jax` | JAX | yes |
| `discopy` | DisCoPy | yes |
| `pytorch` | PyTorch | yes |
| `numpyro` | NumPyro | yes |
| `stan` | Stan | yes |
| `bnlearn` | bnlearn | yes |
: Render targets declared in `src/gnn/render/framework_registry.py`, one row per registry key in registry order. The *Executes* column is the registry's own `supports_execution` flag: 9 of 9 backends have a Step-12 executor, and a `render-only` entry would mean generated code with no Step-12 executor. Read this table against [@tbl:model_families], which shows which families actually target each backend. {#tbl:backend_registry}

Because rendering is kind-aware, the registry is best read as a capability matrix rather than a flat list: which backends can render a discrete categorical model, which can render a continuous linear-Gaussian model, and which of them execute at Step 12. That per-framework, per-kind view is auto-injected below.

| Framework | Discrete render | Continuous render | Executor status |
|---|---|---|---|
| PyMDP | yes | unsupported | executor |
| RxInfer.jl | yes | yes | executor |
| ActiveInference.jl | yes | unsupported | executor |
| JAX | yes | yes | executor |
| DisCoPy | yes | unsupported | executor |
| PyTorch | yes | yes | executor |
| NumPyro | yes | yes | executor |
| Stan | yes | yes | executor |
| bnlearn | yes | unsupported | executor |
: Model kinds each render framework supports, read entirely from the flags in `src/gnn/render/framework_registry.py` — the same source as [@tbl:backend_registry]. A continuous cell of `unsupported` is the renderer's own status for continuous-state models; a render-only entry has no Step-12 executor. Read with [@tbl:model_kinds], which groups the same flags by model kind. {#tbl:framework_capability}

The registry surface of these backends — registry key, display name, implementation language, and which of them the cross-framework gate compares — is summarized in @fig:backend_matrix; the family-by-backend coverage itself is shown in @fig:family_matrix.

![The GNN rendering backend registry as a table: one row per registered backend, with its registry key, display name, implementation language, whether a render-output subdirectory exists under `src/gnn/render/`, and its role in the cross-framework reference comparison. Amber rows are the backends the reliability gate profiles for the continuous family; the tan row (Stan) is declared by that family but sits outside the maintained set, so it is never profiled; a red Render-Subdir cell would mean a registry entry with no subdirectory. The table is read directly from `src/gnn/render/framework_registry.py` and the model-family manifest at commit 13bd0637c, and its footer summarizes the row counts. Take-away: registration, render presence, and profiling status are three different claims, and the table keeps them apart.](../figures/gnn_backend_capability_matrix.png){#fig:backend_matrix width=85%}

### Rendering by Model Kind

**Discrete categorical models** are the fully supported case: every registered backend declares the categorical POMDP vocabulary — the `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` matrices required and `E` optional — so the renderer can emit idiomatic code for all of them, and the cross-framework reference comparison of [@sec:artifacts_evidence] anchors on exactly this breadth.

**Continuous linear-Gaussian models** take the native paths built for them. The RxInfer.jl renderer carries dedicated continuous strategies that emit reactive message-passing code over the Gaussian state-space model; the JAX, PyTorch, and NumPyro renderers generate standalone scripts that filter the belief state numerically — and, when the closed-loop declarations of [@eq:closed_loop] are present, steer it toward the preferred state — with the JAX lane enabling 64-bit precision for the covariance arithmetic; and the Stan renderer emits the model as a probabilistic program. The categorical-only backends — pymdp, ActiveInference.jl, DisCoPy, and bnlearn — do not fabricate a translation: each reports the continuous model as `unsupported`, with a recorded reason, and the status is counted under unsupported framework renderings rather than as a failure — never rendered, never executed, and excluded from the success denominator so the run's rate measures the backends that could actually attempt the model. DisCoPy's boundary is representative: its translator draws categorical POMDP string diagrams and has no linear-Gaussian diagram semantics, so a continuous model is reported unsupported rather than drawn as a discrete stand-in.

**Composed kinds** render through their substrate. A multi-agent model renders along the discrete path, with the per-agent matrix declarations mapped to per-agent structures in the target framework; a hierarchical model renders either composed — the per-level matrices composed into one joint POMDP for the categorical backends — or natively, through the RxInfer.jl two-level strategies; a parameter-learning model renders through the strategy layer that emits joint variational message-passing code for its Dirichlet-declared matrix; and the remaining structural shapes dispatch to their own strategy modules rather than to special cases scattered through the renderers.

**Structural wrappers** have no renderable form at all: they declare boundary structure only, with neither a categorical nor a continuous parameterization, so every framework reports them `unsupported` upstream with the structural-spec reason rather than silently rendering them as a discrete stand-in that would fail on missing matrices. The status is the design working, not a defect: a wrapper is an interface statement, and the pipeline's response is to say so in every receipt rather than to guess a model body the author never declared.

By generating code rather than asking authors to port models by hand, the method keeps a single source of truth in the notation while still reaching the discrete message-passing libraries [@heins2022], reactive message-passing lineage [@bagaev2021reactiveMessagePassing], and categorical, diagrammatic frameworks [@defelice2021] that different research communities have built. The underlying mathematics that compatible backends share — inference over the generative model the notation declares, whether that is categorical free-energy minimization [@dacosta2020; @smith2022] or Gaussian filtering and control — is the common substrate the renderer attempts to preserve; where a backend cannot express a kind faithfully, GNN records that boundary as an explicit unsupported status rather than treating all registered backends as equivalent.

## Execution

### Executing by Model Kind

Generated backend code is not left as a static artifact. The execution stage (step 12) runs the rendered models, driving the inference and behavior that the notation describes and producing concrete traces, beliefs, and outputs. All 9 registered backends — PyMDP, RxInfer.jl, ActiveInference.jl, JAX, DisCoPy, PyTorch, NumPyro, Stan, bnlearn — have an executor at this step, and execution is kind-aware in the same sense rendering is: a backend executes the models its renderer can express, and records an explicit status for the ones it cannot.

**Discrete executors** run the categorical models end to end, and they guard their own runtime assumptions: the generated pymdp scripts, for example, sanity-check the installed library for the current Agent interface at startup and exit fast with a clear message when an unsupported wheel is present, so a stale environment produces a legible diagnostic instead of a mysterious failure deep in a simulation loop.

**Continuous executors** run the generated standalone scripts over the Gaussian state-space model — filtering to a posterior, and with the closed-loop declarations in place, closing the control loop on beliefs — so a continuous model produces traces on the same terms as a discrete one, on the backends that carry the kind.

**Generator-backed and render-adjacent lanes** extend execution beyond the registry's render paths. The bnlearn lane is generator-backed: it renders a runnable Python program from the same parsed model the other lanes consume, and it skips with a recorded status when the `bnlearn` package is absent, so a lean checkout degrades explicitly rather than failing. A separate execute-side bridge verifies rendered Lean documents against the fep_lean bridge contract, which is how the notation reaches a proof assistant without a render-registry entry. Skipped, degraded, and unsupported lanes are recorded as explicit statuses in the cross-framework comparison rather than silently omitted.

This closes the loop from text to running cognitive model: the same specification that was type-checked and exported is now exercised numerically, so that claims about a model's behavior rest on having actually run it rather than on inspection of the source alone.

## Long-Running Orchestration Contracts

GNN 3.0.0 extended the pipeline with three safe-by-design orchestration contracts that let an extended run be observed, paused, resumed, and audited without ever mutating live infrastructure. *Durable observation streams* record file- and array-backed stream manifests with content checksums and replayable execution traces, so that a long run can be re-derived deterministically before any live sensor or device-backed stream is introduced. *Resumable run sessions* carry run-session manifests with atomic checkpoint and resume, status inspection, and cancellation-safe cleanup, so that an extended model-family acceptance run can be interrupted and resumed without corrupting partial state. *Auditable container plans* generate hardened container plans together with an explicit static security review and a rollback descriptor, deliberately stopping short of touching any real cluster. Each contract only generates and validates data; none performs live mutation, and each is governed by a strict acceptance gate and exercised through dedicated Model Context Protocol tools. @fig:orchestration shows how the three contracts compose into one inspectable orchestration surface.

![The three safe-by-design orchestration contracts introduced in GNN 3.0.0, side by side inside the dashed boundary that states their shared invariant: generate and validate data only, never mutate live infrastructure. Each column names the contract's source module under `src/gnn/pipeline/` and chains its stages top to bottom — StreamManifest, ExecutionTrace, and replay for durable observation streams; checkpoint, resume, status, and safe cleanup for resumable run sessions; generate, static security review, and rollback for container plans. Arrows give the order the stages run in, and nothing exits the boundary. The panel is a fixed-layout drawing of the three contracts; the acceptance gates and the Model Context Protocol tools that exercise them are described in the text above. Take-away: long-running orchestration gains capability only as fast as it becomes inspectable.](../figures/gnn_orchestration.png){#fig:orchestration width=85%}

## Analysis, Visualization, and Reporting

The final group of stages turns execution results into interpretable evidence. Analysis (step 16) processes the outputs of execution into structured findings; visualization (step 8) and the rendering of figures (step 9) translate model structure and results into graphical form, supporting the graphical leg of the Triple Play; and the reporting stage (step 23) assembles these artifacts into a coherent summary of what the model is and how it behaved. Because each stage writes its outputs to a known location, the chain from a notation file to a finished report is fully traceable, and any figure or number in a report can be followed back to the step and model that produced it. Analysis reads the per-kind rendering and execution receipts as well: a continuous model whose categorical-only lanes report `unsupported` yields a different evidence profile than one whose continuous-capable lanes failed, and the reports keep those situations apart.

## Reproducibility and Auto-Injection

Every count reported in this manuscript is emitted by the producer `scripts/z_generate_manuscript_variables.py` from the repository state at commit 13bd0637c, not typed by hand. The producer reads that commit's source surfaces directly — the step modules, the source tree, the model-family manifest, and the framework registry — together with the project's maintained ledgers, notably the Model Context Protocol tool audit (`src/gnn/mcp/audit_report.json`, itself regenerated by the test suite). From these it emits a manifest of named tokens — counts of pipeline steps and their modules, source packages and files, model families, backends, example files partitioned by model kind, tests, and tools — plus the two capability tables this manuscript injects: the model-kind table ([@tbl:model_kinds]) and the framework capability matrix ([@tbl:framework_capability]). The renderer substitutes the tokens into the prose at build time. Filesystem-derived counts are recomputed on every run; ledger-derived counts (such as the backend registry) are re-read from a fixed repository state, so a fixed repository state yields the same values, and authors are prohibited from hard-coding any number that has a corresponding token. This makes the manuscript a faithful, regenerable description of the system it documents: when the 25-step pipeline, the 9 rendering backends, or the 30-file example corpus change — or when the discrete-to-continuous exemplar balance shifts — the reported numbers change with them on the next build, and `scripts/check_manuscript_tokens.py` fails the build if a section reintroduces a literal that a token already owns.

# Artifacts and Evidence {#sec:artifacts_evidence}

This section reports what the project has actually produced and how each quantitative claim is grounded. Every number below is substituted at render time from the deterministic producer, which reads the repository state at commit 13bd0637c, so each figure here is regenerated from the artifacts it describes rather than transcribed.

## Model-Family Coverage

GNN ships a curated corpus of model families that exercise the language across the difficulty gradient from minimal parser fixtures to full multi-agent and scaling studies. The manifest registers 9 families (basics, discrete, continuous, hierarchical, multiagent, precision, structured, gridworld, scaling-study) across 9 target directories, and `input/gnn_files` holds 11 corpus directories containing 30 concrete example models. The three sets are not coextensive, and the manuscript does not treat them as one. Registered in no family: `input/gnn_files/learning`, `input/gnn_files/recursive` (2 of the 11 corpus directories), covered in [@sec:limitations_next_steps]. Registered but outside the scanned tree: none, because all 9 target directories are themselves `input/gnn_files` corpus directories. Each family declares the simulation frameworks it is meant to drive, which is what lets the same text model fan out across the executable-model leg of the Triple Play [@gnn2023]. The families and their declared frameworks are enumerated below.

The exemplar corpus partitions cleanly by model kind, and the partition is itself a token: 27 of the 30 example specifications are discrete-state — the discrete categorical kind and its composed variants — and 3 are continuous linear-Gaussian specifications in the continuous family folder. The cold-start index `input/gnn_files/INDEX.md` catalogues every exemplar with its kind, its task folder, and a suggested reading order, and is the fastest surface for a reader who wants to move from this prose to a runnable file of a given kind.

The per-kind evidence is generated, not asserted: families that declare a capability axis (the continuous family declares the continuous-render axis) carry a backend split in [@tbl:model_families] that is generated from the registry's own capability flags, so the table cannot disagree with the code that decides renderability. Reading the ledgers by kind is therefore mechanical — a continuous-family receipt shows the continuous-capable backends attempted and the categorical-only backends recorded `unsupported`, while a discrete-family receipt shows the categorical breadth the cross-framework gate anchors on ([@tbl:framework_capability] is the per-kind key).

| Family | Frameworks | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `basics` | pymdp | Minimal perception fixtures used for parser and validator smoke coverage. |
| `discrete` | pymdp | Discrete POMDP and HMM-style active inference fixtures. |
| `continuous` | jax, numpyro, stan, rxinfer | Continuous-state linear-Gaussian fixtures (F/H/Q/R + Gaussian prior; continuous_navigation closes the loop on beliefs). Native on RxInfer.jl, JAX, PyTorch, NumPyro, Stan; reported unsupported (not failed) on PyMDP, ActiveInference.jl, DisCoPy, bnlearn. |
| `hierarchical` | pymdp, rxinfer, jax | Hierarchical and temporal model fixtures (per-level matrices composed into a joint POMDP for categorical backends; RxInfer.jl renders two-level models natively). |
| `multiagent` | rxinfer | Multi-agent coordination and swarm fixtures. |
| `precision` | pymdp | Precision weighting and curiosity-driven fixtures. |
| `structured` | pymdp | Structured factor graph and posterior fixtures. |
| `gridworld` | pymdp, rxinfer, activeinference_jl | Gridworld POMDP fixture used for cross-framework acceptance checks. |
| `scaling-study` | pymdp | PyMDP scaling-study fixtures, sampled conservatively for acceptance. |
: Model families declared in `input/model_family_manifest.json` with the simulation frameworks each family targets and a generated description. The *Frameworks* column is the family's declared targets, verbatim from the manifest; the capability splits appended to some descriptions are generated from `src/gnn/render/framework_registry.py` flags, not authored in the manifest, so they cannot disagree with the registry. Read with [@tbl:backend_registry] (what each backend is) and [@fig:family_matrix] (the same coverage as a matrix). {#tbl:model_families}

The family-by-framework structure is shown in @fig:family_matrix, which renders the coverage matrix directly from the family registry rather than from a hand-maintained table.

![Model-family coverage across the registered rendering backends: one row per family from `input/model_family_manifest.json`, one column per backend from `src/gnn/render/framework_registry.py`, and a green cell wherever the family declares that backend in its `frameworks` field. The right-hand count states how many backends each family declares; the grid is deliberately sparse — most families declare a single backend, and only continuous, hierarchical, and gridworld declare several. Read it as declared intent, not as profiled outcomes: the gates described below supply the outcomes. The matrix is generated from the two registries at commit 13bd0637c.](../figures/gnn_family_framework_matrix.png){#fig:family_matrix width=85%}

These families are not illustrative prose: they are the inputs over which the parser, the type checker, and the cross-framework code generators are exercised, and they are the substrate for the reliability gates described next.

## Semantic-Fidelity and Cross-Framework Reliability Gates

Two reproducible-by-command gates check that GNN's promise — one text model, many faithful executable renderings — survives contact with real backends. Both live under `scripts/` and read the same family corpus described above, so they verify the artifacts the manuscript actually references.

The semantic-fidelity gate, `scripts/run_semantic_fidelity_gate.py`, checks that a model parsed from GNN text and then re-emitted preserves its semantic content: the state-space structure, the factor and modality declarations, and the matrix shapes implied by a discrete Active Inference generative model survive the round trip [@dacosta2020]. It is meant to be run as a command and to report fidelity per model, not as a static claim baked into prose.

The cross-framework reliability gate, `scripts/run_cross_framework_reliability.py`, takes a single GNN model and renders it across multiple simulation backends, then checks that the resulting executable models agree on the structure they were generated from. The reference comparison runs on the continuous family across JAX, NumPyro, RxInfer.jl — 3 independent Active Inference engines spanning the Python and Julia ecosystems [@heins2022]. The family declares 4 backends (JAX, NumPyro, Stan, RxInfer.jl); Stan is declared but not among the 7 frameworks the gate profiles, so it is excluded from the comparison. Because the same source model drives all 3 renderings, disagreement between backends localizes a generator defect rather than a modeling choice.

Both gates are stated here as commands you can run, not as asserted pass counts. The manuscript deliberately does not quote a fixed number of passing checks: the authoritative, current result is whatever those scripts report when executed against the corpus, and binding a frozen count into prose would invite exactly the drift the auto-injection contract exists to prevent.

A third interchange check extends the same discipline across repositories: `scripts/run_geo_interchange_checks.py` validates the committed pin in `.github/gnn-pair.json` against a selected GEO-INFER checkout and replays exported GNN artifacts — the tracked gridworld, a compiled H3 stay/diffuse model, a rectangular Gaussian, and an explicit factored fixture — inside the GEO environment, writing its receipts even on failure. Like the gates above it is stated as a command, not as a pass count, and its pinned pair (`ActiveInferenceInstitute/GEO-INFER` at a recorded revision) is what makes "interchange" a checkable claim rather than a promise.

## Repository Scale

The repository's scale is itself evidence of the surface that the gates and pipeline cover, and it is reported in @fig:repo_metrics directly from the tracked files at commit 13bd0637c.

![Repository-scale counts on a logarithmic axis: pipeline steps, model families, registered backends, execution backends, Model Context Protocol tools, source packages, test files, example models, and documentation files. Every bar is annotated with its exact value, and every value is a producer token read from `output/data/manuscript_variables.json` at commit 13bd0637c — the same token map that substitutes the prose counts, so the figure cannot disagree with the text without failing the figure-freshness suite. The two backend bars are deliberately distinct: *registered backends* (9) counts render targets, *execution backends* (9) counts the subset that runs at Step 12. Read the chart as the scale of the surface the pipeline maintains, not as a quality measure.](../figures/gnn_repo_metrics.png){#fig:repo_metrics width=80%}

The test suite comprises 456 test files containing 4896 test functions, exercising a source base of 680 Python files across 44 packages (197994 lines of source). The pipeline's step modules — the thin orchestrators named in [@tbl:pipeline_steps] — number 25, one per numbered step. The Model Context Protocol surface — which exposes GNN's capabilities to external agents and tools — provides 142 tools across 32 modules. The pipeline itself runs as 25 steps (0–24), and 7 figure artifacts from the rendering of figures, models, and reports are committed under `output/`, of which 7 are the manuscript's own.

## Claim Discipline

A claim is manuscript-ready only when it is bound to a verifiable artifact. Concretely, every claim in this manuscript must rest on one of four support types:

- A passing test or validator command — for example the semantic-fidelity and cross-framework gates above, which can be re-run on demand.
- A generated output produced by a deterministic producer, such as the figures rendered from the family and repository scans, or the token values emitted by the manuscript-variable producer that backs every number on this page.
- A source ledger, manifest, or configuration file that fixes the value being claimed.
- A resolved entry in `references.bib` for any external-literature claim [@friston2010; @parr2022].

The pipeline records its own evidence trail under `output/`. The run-level summary is written to `output/PIPELINE_REPORT.md`, and the per-step execution record — including which steps ran, their status, and their artifacts — is captured in `output/00_pipeline_summary`. These are the artifacts a reader should consult to confirm that the numbers substituted into this section correspond to a real, reproducible pipeline run rather than to asserted prose. When a value would otherwise need a literal number with no producer behind it, the discipline is to omit the number rather than to hard-code it.

# Reproducibility {#sec:reproducibility}

Reproducibility in GNN is not an aspiration layered on top of the system; it is the operating contract that the pipeline enforces. The 0–24 processing steps are deterministic given a model specification and a target directory, and every published claim in this manuscript is traceable to a command that regenerates the underlying artifact. This section lists only commands that exist in the repository, so that a reader with a clean checkout can reproduce the pipeline, the validation gates, and this manuscript itself.

## Pipeline Smoke Run

The fastest way to confirm a working installation is to drive the full pipeline over the discrete model family without invoking the optional LLM steps:

```bash
uv run python src/gnn/main.py --target-dir input/gnn_files/discrete --output-dir /tmp/gnn-smoke --skip-llm
```

This parses the discrete GNN files, runs visualization and rendering across the maintained backends, and writes all artifacts under the chosen output directory. The `--skip-llm` flag keeps the run hermetic and free of external API calls: the non-LLM steps all execute, the steps that would read the skipped LLM outputs record that as a warning, and the run exits 2 — the pipeline's documented warning code (0 success, 1 error, 2 warning) — rather than 0. To exercise every registered family rather than a single one, drive the manifest through the model-family acceptance gate given below: pointing `--target-dir` at `input/gnn_files` covers that tree's 11 corpus directories. All 9 registered family target directories lie inside that tree, so a single invocation reaches every registered family.

The discrete family exercises the categorical kind end to end. The continuous linear-Gaussian kind smoke-runs the same way, and the contrast between the two runs is itself a check of the per-kind contract:

```bash
uv run python src/gnn/main.py --target-dir input/gnn_files/continuous --output-dir /tmp/gnn-smoke-continuous --skip-llm
```

This parses the continuous specifications, and the render and execute steps fan them out to the continuous-capable backends — where they render as linear-Gaussian models and run as filtering (and, for the closed-loop exemplar, belief-steering) programs — while the categorical-only backends record explicit `unsupported` statuses rather than failures. A reader comparing the two receipts sees the kind taxonomy behaving as described in [@sec:system_context]: same pipeline, same steps, per-kind rendering and execution reach.

## Validation Gates

GNN's reproducibility guarantees rest on a small set of strict, deterministic gates that bind the manuscript's quantitative claims to recomputable ledgers. The model-family acceptance gate runs the maintained families declared in the manifest and fails on any regression:

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_model_family_acceptance.py \
  --manifest input/model_family_manifest.json \
  --output-dir output/model_family_acceptance --strict
```

The semantic-fidelity gate verifies that a parse → serialize → parse round trip preserves variables, edges, dimensions, parameter shapes, equations, time semantics, and ontology mappings across the 9 model families; the cross-framework gate profiles the 7 maintained backends (PyMDP, RxInfer.jl, JAX, NumPyro, PyTorch, ActiveInference.jl, DisCoPy) — refusing any framework outside that set — and records explicit compatible and unsupported statuses rather than silently degrading. Both write their ledgers to an output directory of your choosing:

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_semantic_fidelity_gate.py \
  --manifest input/model_family_manifest.json \
  --output-dir output/semantic_fidelity --strict
uv run python scripts/run_cross_framework_reliability.py \
  --manifest input/model_family_manifest.json \
  --output-dir output/cross_framework --strict
```

Under `--strict`, each gate exits non-zero on the first mismatch, so these commands double as assertions in an automated reproduction run. Code-quality reproducibility is enforced separately through the developer command reference: `just lint` runs the Ruff linter over `src` and `scripts`, and the broader `just quality` recipe chains formatting, terminology, documentation, type, and security checks for a full pre-commit gate.

## Manuscript Reproducibility

This manuscript is itself a reproducible artifact. Every quantitative value in the prose — the pipeline step count, the family and backend counts, the source and test inventories — is a token rather than a hard-coded literal, and the deterministic producer regenerates all of them from the tracked files at the current commit:

```bash
uv run python scripts/z_generate_manuscript_variables.py
```

That command recomputes the {{...}} tokens, persists them to `output/data/manuscript_variables.json` for audit, and hydrates the manuscript sources into `output/manuscript/`. The manuscript's own figures are rebuilt from the same token map:

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.manuscript_build_figures
```

The hydrated sources are then rendered to PDF by the docxology template's render stage. That stage lives in a separate checkout, with this repository symlinked into it at `projects/active/GeneralizedNotationNotation`; run from the template root:

```bash
uv run --frozen python scripts/pipeline/stage_03_render.py \
  --project GeneralizedNotationNotation
```

The render needs a LaTeX installation providing the packages listed in `manuscript/preamble.md` plus `seqsplit`; the template guards `seqsplit` with `\IfFileExists`, so a missing copy degrades rather than failing the build.

Because the variables file is regenerated before rendering, the counts in the rendered PDF track the repository state at the commit recorded in `output/data/manuscript_variables.json` (13bd0637c): a code change that alters, for example, the test inventory (456 test files, 4896 test functions) propagates into the prose on the next regeneration without any manual editing.

## Reproducibility Contract

- Do not cite results that cannot be regenerated or directly traced to a command in this repository.
- Keep generated outputs under `output/` and maintained manuscript source under `manuscript/`; treat everything in `output/` as disposable and regeneratable.
- Express every quantitative claim in the prose as a double-brace `{{...}}` token substituted by `scripts/z_generate_manuscript_variables.py`, never as a hard-coded number.
- Keep private data, credentials, and unpublished sensitive details out of the manuscript and out of version control.
- Record the exact verification commands — the smoke run, the acceptance and fidelity gates, and `just lint` — before marking this manuscript publication-ready.

# Limitations and Next Steps {#sec:limitations_next_steps}

## Current Limitations

GNN 3.3.0 is a working system with deliberately scoped boundaries, and it is worth stating those boundaries plainly rather than implying broader completeness than the artifacts support. The reliability gates that underpin our confidence in the system — the semantic-fidelity ledger and the cross-framework reliability ledger — are reproducible by command and recorded against the 9 model families, but this manuscript does not assert a particular full-suite pass rate as a headline number. Pass and skip counts shift with the local toolchain, the presence or absence of optional simulation dependencies, and whether the optional Ollama integration paths are exercised, so we treat the reproducing command as the durable claim and leave the run-specific tallies to the ledgers and execution traces that the pipeline writes alongside each run. A reader who wants a number should regenerate it in their own environment rather than trust a transcribed digit here.

A second limitation lives at the boundary between the model families and the rendering backends. GNN registers 9 simulation backends, but coverage across the family-by-backend matrix is intentionally uneven, and the gaps are recorded as explicit *profiled-unsupported* statuses rather than silently omitted. The cross-framework acceptance check is anchored on the continuous family, where JAX, NumPyro, RxInfer.jl are compared directly; the continuous and hierarchical families, by contrast, carry profiled-unsupported markers at the render and execute steps (Steps 11 and 12) for backends that cannot yet faithfully realize their continuous-state or temporal-depth structure. This is honest bookkeeping, not a defect to be hidden: an unsupported status with a recorded reason is more trustworthy than a forced translation that quietly misrepresents the model. It also reflects the state of the surrounding literature, where expected-free-energy formulations, variational-inference reductions, and hierarchical active-inference methods are still being actively refined rather than collapsed into one settled executable recipe [@champion2024reframingEfe;@nuijten2026typeInference;@rangarajan2026hierarchicalSuccessor]. The practical consequence is that not every model expressible in the GNN syntax can be executed on every registered backend today, and authors should consult the profiled-unsupported ledger that `scripts/run_model_family_acceptance.py` writes — the command is given in [@sec:reproducibility] — before assuming a given family will round-trip through a given framework. The per-kind shape of that matrix matters as much as its gaps: the categorical-only backends report the continuous linear-Gaussian kind `unsupported` by declared capability rather than by accident, the structural kind is render-only by design on every backend, and the recursive corpus is reserved for bounded autonomous runs and holds no committed models yet — boundaries recorded where the kinds are defined ([@sec:model_kinds]) rather than discovered mid-run.

A third limitation is one of scope rather than capability. The formal account in [@sec:system_context] fixes each kind's parameterization as given — the categorical tensors `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E` of the discrete kind and the system matrices, Gaussian prior, and optional control declarations of the linear-Gaussian kind — and states only belief-level inference: state and policy inference for the categorical kind ([@eq:vfe], [@eq:efe]) and fixed-parameter filtering and control for the continuous kind. GNN can also express *parameter* learning: a matrix may be declared as a latent variable with a Dirichlet prior, and the repository ships both a corpus model that does so (`input/gnn_files/learning/dirichlet_likelihood_learning.md`, which learns its likelihood matrix `A` from observations by joint variational message passing) and the renderer strategy that emits code for it (`src/gnn/render/rxinfer/_strategies_learning.py`). That corpus directory is registered in no manifest family — the unregistered set is exactly `input/gnn_files/learning`, `input/gnn_files/recursive` — so parameter learning is exercised by neither the semantic-fidelity nor the cross-framework ledger and carries no figure or table in this manuscript. We state it here as implemented-but-out-of-scope rather than leave the omission to be inferred from the family tables.

Finally, several capabilities depend on optional dependencies that are not part of the minimal install. The simulation frameworks themselves, the audio sonification path, the LLM-enhanced analysis step, and the interactive visualization step all require extra packages that a lean checkout will not have, and the corresponding pipeline steps degrade to recorded skips rather than failures when those dependencies are absent. This keeps the core parse-validate-export-visualize spine runnable in constrained environments, but it means a full 0–24 traversal of all 25 steps reflects the optional surface that a particular machine has installed. We consider this an acceptable engineering trade for portability, but it is a limitation a reader should hold in mind when interpreting any single end-to-end run.

## Next Steps

The roadmap is concrete and staged. The current release is GNN 3.3.0 ("One Corpus", 2026-09-06). It builds on the three safe-by-design orchestration contracts introduced in GNN 3.0.0, which generate and validate data only, with no live infrastructure mutation. The first is *durable observation streams*: file- and array-backed stream manifests (content-checksummed) with replayable execution traces, so that an extended run can be observed, paused, and re-derived deterministically before any live sensor or device-backed stream is ever introduced. The second is *resumable run sessions*: run-session manifests with atomic checkpoint/resume, status inspection, and cancellation-safe cleanup so that extended model-family acceptance runs can be interrupted and resumed without corrupting partial state. The third is *auditable container plans*: generating hardened container plans with an explicit static security-review and rollback descriptor, deliberately stopping short of mutating any real cluster. Each contract is covered by tests over real objects with negative controls and a strict acceptance gate, additive live wiring connects them to the session-acceptance and run-manifest paths, and three new Model Context Protocol tools expose them. The unifying discipline across all three is that orchestration becomes more capable only as fast as it becomes more inspectable.

The next major release pushes toward bounded autonomy, and it is gated behind the 3.0.0 orchestration work for good reason. The intent is to promote today's proposal-only candidate-scoring machinery — which already ranks candidate patches using the existing validators, model-family ledgers, and interpretability reports — toward *reviewed self-editing of GNN files*. Crucially, the design keeps a human in the loop: edits are proposed and applied only after explicit user approval, with no automatic source mutation, and the autonomy is wrapped in policy, rollback, and audit controls before any self-modifying or distributed action is permitted. This continues the same principle that governs the rest of the system, in the lineage of active-inference accounts of self-organizing systems that act to minimize free energy under explicit generative models [@friston2010; @parr2022]: an agent should expand its license to act only in proportion to the reviewability of what it does. The next-release items are not claimed as complete here; they are the recorded direction of travel, and each will be evidenced by its own gates when it lands, just as the 3.0.0 contracts are evidenced by theirs today. On the model-kind axis the same staging applies: extending native hierarchical rendering beyond the two-level strategies, broadening continuous reach across the remaining registered backends, and populating the reserved recursive corpus each arrive with their own gate evidence rather than by prose assertion.

# Supplemental Source Surface {#sec:source_surface}

This supplement records the top-level source surfaces a reader or reviewer should inspect before turning any prose in the main manuscript into a verifiable claim. Each surface below is authored material under version control; the generated artifacts it produces are described separately so that the boundary between hand-written source and reproducible output stays explicit.

The `src/` tree is the executable core of GNN. It is organized into 44 Python packages spanning 680 source files and roughly 197994 lines of code. Alongside these packages sit the 25 top-level step modules (0–24) that implement the numbered pipeline as thin orchestrators delegating into the packages, each module owning one stage of the progression from a parsed GNN text model through visualization, type checking, code export, and executable cognitive simulation. Every claim the manuscript makes about pipeline behavior should be traceable to one of these step modules rather than to descriptive prose alone.

The `input/` tree holds the model corpora that exercise the pipeline. Its `gnn_files/` subtree contains 11 corpus directories organized by model family, together totaling 30 example files — 27 discrete-state specifications and 3 continuous linear-Gaussian specifications, the partition the manuscript's model-kind accounting uses ([@sec:model_kinds]). The cold-start index `input/gnn_files/INDEX.md` catalogues every exemplar with its kind and task folder, and the `recursive/` directory is reserved for bounded `--autonomous` proposal-loop runs, holding no committed models. Every model file under `input/` lives in that subtree, so the 30-file count covers the whole tree. A `model_family_manifest.json` enumerates the 9 registered families and their target directories. This manifest is the authoritative registry that downstream steps and the manuscript variable producer read when they report family counts and cross-framework coverage; it should be consulted directly rather than inferred from directory listings.

The `scripts/` tree contains the thin orchestrators that gate and reproduce the project. These include the acceptance scripts that confirm the pipeline runs end to end, the reliability gates that enforce determinism and coverage expectations, and the manuscript variable producer (`src/gnn/manuscript/variables.py` driven from this layer) that emits the double-brace `{{...}}` token values consumed throughout the manuscript. Treating these scripts as the source of reproduction commands keeps reported numbers bound to what the code actually computes.

The `docs/` tree is the prose and reference surface, comprising 624 files of specification, tutorial, and design documentation for the GNN language and its Active Inference grounding [@gnn2023]. It is the place to verify that a manuscript statement about GNN syntax or semantics matches the documented language rather than a convenient paraphrase.

The `output/` tree collects per-step pipeline artifacts: the data dumps, intermediate representations, validation reports, and the 7 figure artifacts committed under it. Everything here is disposable and reproducible from the surfaces above, so it should be read as evidence of a run rather than as authored source. Notably, `output/data/manuscript_variables.json` is where the manuscript's substituted token values are materialized.

## Authored Source Versus Generated Output

`src/`, `scripts/`, `input/`, `docs/` and `manuscript/` are authored and reviewed; everything under `output/` is generated and disposable, including `output/manuscript/`, which holds the token-substituted copies of the `manuscript/` sources rather than the sources themselves. The commands that regenerate the output surfaces are listed in [@sec:reproducibility]: the smoke run for the per-step artifacts, `scripts/z_generate_manuscript_variables.py` for the token map and the hydrated sections, `scripts.manuscript_build_figures` for the 7 manuscript figures, and the template render stage for the PDF. Which values become tokens is not a matter of taste: any quantity the producer can derive from a source surface is a token, `scripts/check_manuscript_tokens.py` fails the build when a section hard-codes one instead, and the resulting 93-entry map is committed at `output/data/manuscript_variables.json` for audit. External references are resolved from `manuscript/references.bib`, which the same gate cross-checks against every citation key in the prose. This manuscript quotes no private or unpublished material.

# Symbols and Glossary {#sec:symbols_glossary}

This glossary defines the Generalized Notation Notation (GNN) language constructs
used to specify generative models, together with the Active Inference symbols
those constructs carry across the model kinds of [@sec:model_kinds]. Definitions
follow the GNN syntax specification and the exemplar specifications distributed
with the repository — the discrete POMDP exemplars and the continuous
linear-Gaussian exemplars alike — and they align with the standard formulations
of both kinds [@gnn2023; @dacosta2020; @parr2022].

## Language Constructs

A GNN file is an ordered, UTF-8 Markdown document whose level-2 headers name
required and optional sections. The strict schema validator enforces section
order, declaration grammar, and connection syntax; the constructs below are the
load-bearing sections a parser must recognize; they are catalogued in [@tbl:gnn_constructs].

| Construct | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `## GNNSection` | Required short identifier for the model block (no spaces, e.g. `ActInfPOMDP`). |
| `## GNNVersionAndFlags` | Required version declaration (`GNN v1` or `GNN v1.1`) with optional flags. |
| `## ModelName` | Required human-readable title of the generative model. |
| `## StateSpaceBlock` | Required block declaring every variable and matrix as `NAME[dim, …, type=…]`, one per line — the block whose declared vocabulary fixes the model's kind. |
| `## Connections` | Required edge list relating state-space variables, expressing the model's factor graph. |
| `## ModelAnnotation` | Optional free-text description of the model's modalities, factors, and assumptions. |
| `## InitialParameterization` | Optional concrete numeric values for declared matrices and vectors. |
| `## ActInfOntologyAnnotation` | Optional bindings from each variable to a CamelCase Active Inference ontology term. |
| `## ModelParameters` | Optional key-value dimensions (e.g. `num_hidden_states`, `num_obs`, `num_actions`) consumed by code generators. |
| `## Time` | Optional dynamics declaration: a time variable plus `Dynamic`/`Static`, `Discrete`/`Continuous`, and `ModelTimeHorizon`. |
| `## Equations` | Optional LaTeX-rendered formulas defining model dynamics and the relationships between declared variables; round-tripped by the semantic-fidelity gate. |
| `## Footer` | Optional closing section that terminates the file and lets a reader or parser enter it from either end. |
| `## Signature` | Optional provenance block carrying a cryptographic signature over the specification. |
| `NAME[d₁,d₂,…,type=…]` | A variable or tensor declaration; dimensions are positive integers or named references, and a `type` (`float`, `int`, `bool`) is required. |
| `A>B` | Directed (causal) connection operator: edge from `A` to `B`, e.g. `D>s` (a prior conditions a hidden state) or `F>x` (a transition matrix drives a continuous state). |
| `A-B` | Undirected (bidirectional) connection operator, e.g. `s-A` (a hidden state participates in the likelihood mapping). |
| `A>B:label` / `A-B:label` | A v1.1 annotated edge; the trailing label documents the relation and is preserved but may be ignored for structural validation. |
| `default=…` | A v1.1 declaration hint (`uniform`, `zeros`, `ones`, `eye`, `random`) supplying an initialization for a matrix or vector. |
: The GNN language constructs a conforming parser must recognize, with the meaning each carries. The first rows are the required sections that pin a model's identity, variables, and factor graph; the optional sections that follow carry parameterization, ontology bindings, timing, equations, and provenance. The operator rows are the connection vocabulary the `Connections` section is written in — directed `A>B`, undirected `A-B`, and their labeled v1.1 forms — and `default=…` supplies initialization hints. Definitions follow the GNN syntax specification and the exemplar specifications under `input/gnn_files`, and the strict schema validator enforces section order and declaration grammar before any downstream step runs. The construct vocabulary is deliberately kind-agnostic: the same `StateSpaceBlock`, `Connections`, and operator syntax declare a discrete categorical model, a continuous linear-Gaussian model, or a composed multi-agent or hierarchical one — what differs between kinds is which matrix names the block declares, as [@tbl:actinf_symbols] details. {#tbl:gnn_constructs}

## Symbols by Model Kind

The exemplar specifications declare the generative-model components of Active
Inference, mapping each GNN variable to its probabilistic meaning
[@dacosta2020; @smith2022; @parr2022]. Because the notation spans model kinds,
the same letter can name different objects in different kinds — most prominently
`F`, which is the variational free energy of [@eq:vfe] in the discrete kind and
the state-transition matrix of [@eq:lgssm_state] in the continuous kind — so each
row of [@tbl:actinf_symbols] names the kind its reading belongs to and the
equation in [@sec:system_context] that fixes it, and the glossary and the formal
statement cannot drift apart.

| Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `A` | Discrete kind: likelihood (observation) matrix encoding $P(o \mid s)$, a column-stochastic map from hidden states to observation outcomes ([@eq:likelihood]). |
| `B` | Discrete kind: transition tensor encoding $P(s' \mid s, u)$, one column-stochastic slice per action in the canonical `B[next_state][previous_state][action]` order ([@eq:transition]). |
| `C` | Discrete kind: preference vector — log-preferences over observation outcomes that bias the agent toward preferred outcomes ([@eq:preference]). |
| `D` | Discrete kind: prior vector over initial hidden states ([@eq:prior]). |
| `E` | Discrete kind: habit vector — an initial policy prior over actions, entering the policy posterior ([@eq:policy]). |
| `s` | Discrete kind: current hidden-state distribution; `s_prime` (`s'`) is the next hidden-state distribution. |
| `o` | Discrete kind: current observation, an integer index over outcome modalities. |
| `π` | Discrete kind: policy — a distribution over actions inferred from expected free energy ([@eq:policy]). |
| `u` | Discrete kind: the selected (sampled) action, sampled from the policy posterior. Continuous kind: the control input added to the state each step ([@eq:lgssm_state]). |
| `F` | Discrete kind: variational free energy, minimized during state inference ([@eq:vfe]) [@friston2010]. Continuous kind: the state-transition matrix of the linear-Gaussian model ([@eq:lgssm_state]). |
| `G` | Discrete kind: expected free energy per policy, minimized during policy inference to score candidate actions ([@eq:efe]) [@dacosta2020]. |
| `t` | Discrete time step; the horizon $T$ bounds the product in [@eq:generative_model]. Continuous kind: the time index of the state-space model. |
| `H` | Continuous kind: observation matrix mapping the latent state to the observation ([@eq:lgssm_obs]). |
| `Q` | Continuous kind: process-noise covariance of the state evolution ([@eq:lgssm_state]). |
| `R` | Continuous kind: observation-noise covariance of the readout ([@eq:lgssm_obs]). |
| `x` | Continuous kind: the Gaussian latent state $x_t$; `x[2,1,type=float]` in the navigation exemplar declares a two-dimensional position. |
| `y` | Continuous kind: the continuous observation read out linearly from the state ([@eq:lgssm_obs]). |
| `prior_mean` | Continuous kind: prior mean $\mu_0$ over the initial latent state ([@eq:lgssm_state]). |
| `prior_cov` | Continuous kind: prior covariance $\Sigma_0$ over the initial latent state ([@eq:lgssm_state]). |
| `goal_mean` | Continuous kind: preferred state $\mu^\star$ the closed-loop controller steers toward ([@eq:closed_loop]). |
| `control_gain` | Continuous kind: scalar proportional gain $k$ on the belief error in the closed loop ([@eq:closed_loop]). |
: The Active Inference symbols a GNN specification carries, scoped by model kind and bound to the equation of [@sec:system_context] that fixes each role. Read the discrete-kind rows as the categorical generative-model tensors (likelihood, controlled transitions, log-preferences, prior over initial states, habit prior) with `s`, `o`, `π`, and `u` as the inference variables and `F` and `G` as the two free-energy functionals minimized at [@eq:vfe] and [@eq:efe]; read the continuous-kind rows as the linear-Gaussian parameterization — system matrices, covariances, Gaussian prior, and the optional closed-loop declarations of [@eq:closed_loop]. The rows where one letter carries two kind-scoped readings (`F`, `u`, `t`) are deliberate: the notation reuses a compact alphabet across kinds, and the declared matrix vocabulary of the `StateSpaceBlock` — not the letter alone — is what fixes the reading, which is exactly what the kind classification of [@sec:model_kinds] computes. Use the table as a decoding key when reading a `StateSpaceBlock`: every declared matrix name should map to exactly one kind-scoped row here, and the `## ActInfOntologyAnnotation` bindings described below are what make that mapping machine-checkable downstream. {#tbl:actinf_symbols}

## Ontology Bindings and Implementations

The `## ActInfOntologyAnnotation` section binds each variable to a canonical term
— `A=LikelihoodMatrix`, `B=TransitionMatrix`, `C=LogPreferenceVector`,
`D=PriorOverHiddenStates`, `s=HiddenState`, `o=Observation`, `π=PolicyVector` in
the discrete exemplars; `F=StateTransitionMatrix`, `H=ObservationMatrix`,
`Q=ProcessNoiseCovariance`, `R=ObservationNoiseCovariance`,
`prior_mean=PriorMean`, `prior_cov=PriorCovariance`, `goal_mean=PreferredState`,
`control_gain=ControlGain`, `x=ContinuousHiddenState`,
`y=ContinuousObservation`, `u=ControlInput` in the continuous exemplars — which
downstream pipeline steps use for semantic analysis and validation. The bindings
are per-kind by construction: a continuous exemplar binds `F` to
`StateTransitionMatrix`, never to a free-energy term, so the ontology layer
carries the same kind-scoped reading [@tbl:actinf_symbols] fixes by hand.
The same GNN specification feeds the project's rendering backends — including the
9 registered targets (PyMDP, RxInfer.jl, ActiveInference.jl, JAX, DisCoPy, PyTorch, NumPyro, Stan, bnlearn), of which the
9 listed as executable
(PyMDP, RxInfer.jl, ActiveInference.jl, JAX, DisCoPy, PyTorch, NumPyro, Stan, bnlearn) also run at Step 12 — with
per-kind reach recorded as explicit statuses ([@tbl:framework_capability]) — so
that a model written once in this notation can be parsed, visualized, and
executed across the 25-step pipeline (0–24)
without restating its mathematics [@gnn2023; @heins2022; @defelice2021].
