# Symbols and Glossary {#sec:symbols_glossary}

This glossary defines the Generalized Notation Notation (GNN) language constructs
used to specify generative models, together with the Active Inference symbols
those constructs carry across the model kinds of [@sec:model_kinds]. Definitions
follow the GNN syntax specification and the exemplar specifications distributed
with the repository — the discrete POMDP exemplars and the continuous
linear-Gaussian exemplars alike — and they align with the standard formulations
of both kinds [@gnn2023; @dacosta2020; @parr2022].

## Language Constructs

A GNN file is an ordered, UTF-8 Markdown document whose level-2 headers name
required and optional sections. The strict schema validator enforces section
order, declaration grammar, and connection syntax; the constructs below are the
load-bearing sections a parser must recognize; they are catalogued in [@tbl:gnn_constructs].

| Construct | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `## GNNSection` | Required short identifier for the model block (no spaces, e.g. `ActInfPOMDP`). |
| `## GNNVersionAndFlags` | Required version declaration (`GNN v1` or `GNN v1.1`) with optional flags. |
| `## ModelName` | Required human-readable title of the generative model. |
| `## StateSpaceBlock` | Required block declaring every variable and matrix as `NAME[dim, …, type=…]`, one per line — the block whose declared vocabulary fixes the model's kind. |
| `## Connections` | Required edge list relating state-space variables, expressing the model's factor graph. |
| `## ModelAnnotation` | Optional free-text description of the model's modalities, factors, and assumptions. |
| `## InitialParameterization` | Optional concrete numeric values for declared matrices and vectors. |
| `## ActInfOntologyAnnotation` | Optional bindings from each variable to a CamelCase Active Inference ontology term. |
| `## ModelParameters` | Optional key-value dimensions (e.g. `num_hidden_states`, `num_obs`, `num_actions`) consumed by code generators. |
| `## Time` | Optional dynamics declaration: a time variable plus `Dynamic`/`Static`, `Discrete`/`Continuous`, and `ModelTimeHorizon`. |
| `## Equations` | Optional LaTeX-rendered formulas defining model dynamics and the relationships between declared variables; round-tripped by the semantic-fidelity gate. |
| `## Footer` | Optional closing section that terminates the file and lets a reader or parser enter it from either end. |
| `## Signature` | Optional provenance block carrying a cryptographic signature over the specification. |
| `NAME[d₁,d₂,…,type=…]` | A variable or tensor declaration; dimensions are positive integers or named references, and a `type` (`float`, `int`, `bool`) is required. |
| `A>B` | Directed (causal) connection operator: edge from `A` to `B`, e.g. `D>s` (a prior conditions a hidden state) or `F>x` (a transition matrix drives a continuous state). |
| `A-B` | Undirected (bidirectional) connection operator, e.g. `s-A` (a hidden state participates in the likelihood mapping). |
| `A>B:label` / `A-B:label` | A v1.1 annotated edge; the trailing label documents the relation and is preserved but may be ignored for structural validation. |
| `default=…` | A v1.1 declaration hint (`uniform`, `zeros`, `ones`, `eye`, `random`) supplying an initialization for a matrix or vector. |
: The GNN language constructs a conforming parser must recognize, with the meaning each carries. The first rows are the required sections that pin a model's identity, variables, and factor graph; the optional sections that follow carry parameterization, ontology bindings, timing, equations, and provenance. The operator rows are the connection vocabulary the `Connections` section is written in — directed `A>B`, undirected `A-B`, and their labeled v1.1 forms — and `default=…` supplies initialization hints. Definitions follow the GNN syntax specification and the exemplar specifications under `input/gnn_files`, and the strict schema validator enforces section order and declaration grammar before any downstream step runs. The construct vocabulary is deliberately kind-agnostic: the same `StateSpaceBlock`, `Connections`, and operator syntax declare a discrete categorical model, a continuous linear-Gaussian model, or a composed multi-agent or hierarchical one — what differs between kinds is which matrix names the block declares, as [@tbl:actinf_symbols] details. {#tbl:gnn_constructs}

## Symbols by Model Kind

The exemplar specifications declare the generative-model components of Active
Inference, mapping each GNN variable to its probabilistic meaning
[@dacosta2020; @smith2022; @parr2022]. Because the notation spans model kinds,
the same letter can name different objects in different kinds — most prominently
`F`, which is the variational free energy of [@eq:vfe] in the discrete kind and
the state-transition matrix of [@eq:lgssm_state] in the continuous kind — so each
row of [@tbl:actinf_symbols] names the kind its reading belongs to and the
equation in [@sec:system_context] that fixes it, and the glossary and the formal
statement cannot drift apart.

| Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `A` | Discrete kind: likelihood (observation) matrix encoding $P(o \mid s)$, a column-stochastic map from hidden states to observation outcomes ([@eq:likelihood]). |
| `B` | Discrete kind: transition tensor encoding $P(s' \mid s, u)$, one column-stochastic slice per action in the canonical `B[next_state][previous_state][action]` order ([@eq:transition]). |
| `C` | Discrete kind: preference vector — log-preferences over observation outcomes that bias the agent toward preferred outcomes ([@eq:preference]). |
| `D` | Discrete kind: prior vector over initial hidden states ([@eq:prior]). |
| `E` | Discrete kind: habit vector — an initial policy prior over actions, entering the policy posterior ([@eq:policy]). |
| `s` | Discrete kind: current hidden-state distribution; `s_prime` (`s'`) is the next hidden-state distribution. |
| `o` | Discrete kind: current observation, an integer index over outcome modalities. |
| `π` | Discrete kind: policy — a distribution over actions inferred from expected free energy ([@eq:policy]). |
| `u` | Discrete kind: the selected (sampled) action, sampled from the policy posterior. Continuous kind: the control input added to the state each step ([@eq:lgssm_state]). |
| `F` | Discrete kind: variational free energy, minimized during state inference ([@eq:vfe]) [@friston2010]. Continuous kind: the state-transition matrix of the linear-Gaussian model ([@eq:lgssm_state]). |
| `G` | Discrete kind: expected free energy per policy, minimized during policy inference to score candidate actions ([@eq:efe]) [@dacosta2020]. |
| `t` | Discrete time step; the horizon $T$ bounds the product in [@eq:generative_model]. Continuous kind: the time index of the state-space model. |
| `H` | Continuous kind: observation matrix mapping the latent state to the observation ([@eq:lgssm_obs]). |
| `Q` | Continuous kind: process-noise covariance of the state evolution ([@eq:lgssm_state]). |
| `R` | Continuous kind: observation-noise covariance of the readout ([@eq:lgssm_obs]). |
| `x` | Continuous kind: the Gaussian latent state $x_t$; `x[2,1,type=float]` in the navigation exemplar declares a two-dimensional position. |
| `y` | Continuous kind: the continuous observation read out linearly from the state ([@eq:lgssm_obs]). |
| `prior_mean` | Continuous kind: prior mean $\mu_0$ over the initial latent state ([@eq:lgssm_state]). |
| `prior_cov` | Continuous kind: prior covariance $\Sigma_0$ over the initial latent state ([@eq:lgssm_state]). |
| `goal_mean` | Continuous kind: preferred state $\mu^\star$ the closed-loop controller steers toward ([@eq:closed_loop]). |
| `control_gain` | Continuous kind: scalar proportional gain $k$ on the belief error in the closed loop ([@eq:closed_loop]). |
: The Active Inference symbols a GNN specification carries, scoped by model kind and bound to the equation of [@sec:system_context] that fixes each role. Read the discrete-kind rows as the categorical generative-model tensors (likelihood, controlled transitions, log-preferences, prior over initial states, habit prior) with `s`, `o`, `π`, and `u` as the inference variables and `F` and `G` as the two free-energy functionals minimized at [@eq:vfe] and [@eq:efe]; read the continuous-kind rows as the linear-Gaussian parameterization — system matrices, covariances, Gaussian prior, and the optional closed-loop declarations of [@eq:closed_loop]. The rows where one letter carries two kind-scoped readings (`F`, `u`, `t`) are deliberate: the notation reuses a compact alphabet across kinds, and the declared matrix vocabulary of the `StateSpaceBlock` — not the letter alone — is what fixes the reading, which is exactly what the kind classification of [@sec:model_kinds] computes. Use the table as a decoding key when reading a `StateSpaceBlock`: every declared matrix name should map to exactly one kind-scoped row here, and the `## ActInfOntologyAnnotation` bindings described below are what make that mapping machine-checkable downstream. {#tbl:actinf_symbols}

## Ontology Bindings and Implementations

The `## ActInfOntologyAnnotation` section binds each variable to a canonical term
— `A=LikelihoodMatrix`, `B=TransitionMatrix`, `C=LogPreferenceVector`,
`D=PriorOverHiddenStates`, `s=HiddenState`, `o=Observation`, `π=PolicyVector` in
the discrete exemplars; `F=StateTransitionMatrix`, `H=ObservationMatrix`,
`Q=ProcessNoiseCovariance`, `R=ObservationNoiseCovariance`,
`prior_mean=PriorMean`, `prior_cov=PriorCovariance`, `goal_mean=PreferredState`,
`control_gain=ControlGain`, `x=ContinuousHiddenState`,
`y=ContinuousObservation`, `u=ControlInput` in the continuous exemplars — which
downstream pipeline steps use for semantic analysis and validation. The bindings
are per-kind by construction: a continuous exemplar binds `F` to
`StateTransitionMatrix`, never to a free-energy term, so the ontology layer
carries the same kind-scoped reading [@tbl:actinf_symbols] fixes by hand.
The same GNN specification feeds the project's rendering backends — including the
10 registered targets (PyMDP, RxInfer.jl, ActiveInference.jl, JAX, DisCoPy, PyTorch, NumPyro, Stan, bnlearn, ngc-learn), of which the
10 listed as executable
(PyMDP, RxInfer.jl, ActiveInference.jl, JAX, DisCoPy, PyTorch, NumPyro, Stan, bnlearn, ngc-learn) also run at Step 12 — with
per-kind reach recorded as explicit statuses ([@tbl:framework_capability]) — so
that a model written once in this notation can be parsed, visualized, and
executed across the 25-step pipeline (0–24)
without restating its mathematics [@gnn2023; @heins2022; @defelice2021].
