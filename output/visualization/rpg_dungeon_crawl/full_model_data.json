  "ModelAnnotation": "This model represents a comprehensive Role Playing Game scenario with:\n- Multiple player characters (Fighter, Mage, Rogue, Cleric) each with distinct capabilities and goals\n- Dungeon Master as an adaptive environmental controller and narrative agent\n- Dynamic labyrinth environment with rooms, corridors, traps, monsters, and treasures\n- Multi-modal observations (visual, auditory, tactical, social, magical)\n- Complex action spaces (movement, combat, magic, social interaction, exploration)\n- Collaborative decision-making with turn-based coordination\n- Uncertainty from dice mechanics and hidden information\n- Hierarchical goal structures (immediate survival, quest objectives, character development)\n- Emergent narrative through agent interactions and environmental responses\n\nThe model enables rich collaborative gameplay with adaptive AI agents that can:\n- Plan coordinated strategies while maintaining individual character motivations\n- Adapt to unexpected environmental changes and DM narrative decisions\n- Learn from experience and develop character-specific expertise\n- Balance competition and cooperation in dynamic social situations\n- Generate emergent storytelling through believable character interactions",
