  "ModelName": "Classic Active Inference POMDP Agent v1",
  "ModelAnnotation": "This model describes a classic Active Inference agent for a discrete POMDP:\n- One observation modality (\"state_observation\") with 3 possible outcomes.\n- One hidden state factor (\"location\") with 3 possible states.\n- The hidden state is fully controllable via 3 discrete actions.\n- The agent's preferences are encoded as log-probabilities over observations.\n- The agent has an initial policy prior (habit) encoded as log-probabilities over actions.\n- All parameterizations are explicit and suitable for translation to code or simulation in any Active Inference framework.",

  "Time": "Dynamic\nDiscreteTime=t\nModelTimeHorizon=Unbounded # The agent is defined for an unbounded time horizon; simulation runs may specify a finite horizon.",
