  "ModelAnnotation": "This model represents the complex dynamics of catnip (Nepeta cataria) through its natural history,\nfrom germination to peak nepetalactone production, and the corresponding feline behavioral responses.\n\nThe model is specifically designed to generate melodious audio through SAPF processing that will appeal to cats:\n- Frequency mappings optimized for feline hearing (1-3 kHz sweet spot)\n- Harmonic structures based on purr frequencies (20-50 Hz fundamentals)\n- Temporal dynamics that mirror natural cat behavior patterns\n- Multi-modal sensory representations (visual, olfactory, tactile)\n\nHidden state factors model:\n1. Catnip growth phases (5 states): Germination \u2192 Vegetative \u2192 Budding \u2192 Flowering \u2192 Seed Production\n2. Nepetalactone concentration levels (4 states): Minimal \u2192 Low \u2192 Peak \u2192 Declining\n3. Seasonal environmental conditions (4 states): Spring \u2192 Summer \u2192 Autumn \u2192 Winter\n4. Feline response intensity (6 states): Indifferent \u2192 Curious \u2192 Interested \u2192 Excited \u2192 Euphoric \u2192 Overstimulated\n\nObservation modalities capture:\n1. Visual appearance (plant morphology, leaf density, flower presence)\n2. Olfactory intensity (nepetalactone scent strength)\n3. Tactile qualities (leaf texture, stem firmness)\n4. Feline behavioral responses (approach, investigation, rolling, vocalizations)\n\nThe model incorporates circadian rhythms, seasonal variations, and the famous \"catnip high\" cycle\nthat creates natural oscillatory patterns perfect for musical generation.",
